# --- POSITION MODEL (DPP STRIP 2026-07-05, final consolidation): the DPP weighted-blend is DELETED. The store
#   now carries THREE clean SINGLE-VALUED columns (no probabilistic legs anywhere):
#   drafted_position : career/draft position -> drives the cohort curves (the engine's internal p['pos'])
#   present_position : the player's CURRENT position -> the YEAR-0 leg of his own valuation (p['_pos_now'])
#   future_position  : the player's SETTLED FUTURE position -> the YEARS-1+ leg + curve/peak/runway (p['_futpos'])
# Pricing reads present_position for the year-0 REPL bar (bnow) and future_position for the years-1+ REPL bar
# and the peak/curve (gfut). In THIS build future_position == present_position for every player, so bnow==gfut
# and every player resolves as a single position -- but the SEAM is live: a later transition model can populate
# future_position where it should differ from present, with no schema change and no code change. The old
# raw_multipos blend (futblend weights, gfut multi-leg, _fut list) is GONE; each dual is collapsed to its
# primary (present/dominant) leg. See evidence/dpp_strip/ for the full re-pricing.

# OBITUARY (seg-2 posval-COMPONENT wiring — delete-don't-disable, SSI/CORE rule 7). The ORIGINAL design
# (register items 211/213) wrapped the map at SIX posval sites via `posval_uncomp(lev,pos,Eq)`: the k-legs
# of proj_from_peak/prod_floor here AND the W4 _proj_w4/_prod_floor_w4 in _merged_recover. That placement
# was PROVEN to compress BY CONSTRUCTION (register 221): the REPL offset makes local elasticity >=1 at
# posval for elites, so blending toward an elasticity-1 target pulls elite production DOWN, not up. The
# axis finding (register 224) then located the deeper defect — the rho AXIS: level_now's output-elasticity
# is only 0.124 (measured), so any blend toward V_ref*rho(level_now) flattens price-vs-output regardless of
# hook. MEMO v1.1 CURES BOTH: the map moves to the PRODUCTION-VALUE hook (pr=price6, ONCE per player, at
# _merged_recover.py raw_ev:298), and rho tracks REALISED OUTPUT. `posval_uncomp` + the per-leg E/CAL state
# + the L_ref/V_ref dicts are DELETED here; the six posval sites are RESTORED to their pre-seg-2 originals
# (posval(lev+capt_prem(lev)-REPL)). The v1.1 map, its references (RHO_DEN/V_ref_b) and the C[pos]
# conservation now live in _merged_recover (co-located with the hook). This module keeps ONLY the declared
# kill-switch + dials below (the RL_ISOFADE / RL_EVW pattern — NOT a manifest dial). RL_UNCOMP=0 (or the
# strength dial unset) => the map is INERT => board 8d90c9ac BYTE-EXACT (config_sha256 UNMOVED).

# <27:8.8% / 27-29:3.9% / 30+:0) is DELETED. Its own docstring said "next build's return data supersedes it"
# — this is that build. A curated register + an inference stopgap firing on the same 0-games-2026 signal is a
# double-count; the register beats inference (Luke's word over a heuristic). The k=0 haircut PLUMBING is kept
# and re-pointed to the register-driven _avail_hc (proj_from_peak :328/:408, prod_floor, _proj_w4, rl_export,
# distribution_pricing). `_b2hc` was a runtime-only field (never in the store) -> store md5 UNCHANGED, no
# re-seal. Measured pre-strip: exactly {nicholas-martin, tom-green} carried _b2hc>0, BOTH register names, so

# development INVERTS the dynasty ranking (young pedigree assets crater as decay=1-(seasons-1)/4.5 fades
# their pick value with nothing to replace it; established older players rise). The forward board is only
# meaningful once Phase 2 projects development to offset that fade -> build the two together.
