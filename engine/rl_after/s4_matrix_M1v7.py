# (1) RESURRECTED the deleted upper-quantile compression cB=0.47*clip((effs-1)/3,0,1) on bb[3]/bb[4] -- gone
# from the engine since 02/07/2026 (_merged_recover v7-cB DELETED) -- and (2) wrapped the engine's ALREADY
# v7-wrapped b6 with _v7 AGAIN, so the age-taper `asc` was applied TWICE. Net: the book UNDER-priced the same
# players the board over-priced (Josh Ward engine 1640 -> book 1233, -24.8%). F2.
# AFTER: nothing is re-injected. The walk-forward book is built from the LIVE gated engine ev() -- the single
# valuation source -- so every book cell equals the engine's gated value by construction. A parity check at the
# end asserts book(current-year) == engine gated ev() for every player, matched by stable key, or the build FAILS.
