# DISTRIBUTION PRICING (U21-4) — FINISHED MODEL (cont.24).
# Builds on forward_valuation/distribution_pricing_prototype.py, wiring all 6 spec TODOs.
# Full design: ../DISTRIBUTION_PRICING_SPEC.md. NOT wired into value() — this is a standalone repricer.
#
# THE WHOLE THING IN ONE FLOW:
#   1. BAND: freehand quantile models (q10/30/50/70/90) of forward best-3, on the engine's own features.
#   2. v_at_peak(p,L): value the player AS IF forward-peak = L, through the REAL production chain at the
#      player's REAL age (not PEAK_AGE) — so old stars decline (TODO#1) and proven stars hit their real
#      value() to the dollar (TODO#6). This is the convex map E[v(L)] pays the upside tail / discounts a
#      collapsed one — no separate pedestal / cvx / runway needed.
#   3. PRIOR: pedigree-graded forward-peak prior (centre+width) per position×pick, with the top of the
#      draft built by TREND EXTRAPOLATION (loclin / a*k^-b), not truncated neighbour-average (TODO#4).
#   4. SHRINK: blend each player's empirical band toward that prior IN PROPORTION TO LOCAL DATA THINNESS
#      (a function of LOCAL DATA COUNT, not pick) (TODO#3). K_SHRINK strength is SURFACED, not baked.
#   5. dist_value(p) = SCALE_DIST * E[v_at_peak over the shrunk band]. SCALE_DIST harness-calibrated (TODO#5).
#   6. GUARDRAILS: monotone quantiles (sort) + width-by-age sanity vs the empirical table (TODO#2).
