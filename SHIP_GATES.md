# SHIP_GATES.md — AFL SuperCoach RL engine — FROZEN ACCEPTANCE SUITE
### Status: FROZEN (02/07/2026) — all decisions resolved by Luke; the commit of
### this file to the repo WAS the freeze act (Luke, 02/07/2026).
### Rule: when every gate passes, the engine SHIPS and gets used for real trades.
### Post-freeze the list does not grow — new reads go to V_NEXT.md unless they
### demonstrate an existing gate is broken. Every line becomes a scripted PASS/FAIL
### check (ship_gates_check.py), run at each candidate head and at any bake.
###
### SCRIPTING NOTES (for the build):
### - EXACT-ID matching mandatory: the suite contains Harley Reid AND Zach Reid;
###   the league contains two Uwlands. No substring matching.
### - Line-ball = within ±20% (Luke, 02/07/2026).
### - A13-A14 are PVC-coupled: staged PENDING (not RED) until the pick curve exists.
### - A6 pick-matching: finest resolution with smoothing; pool the thin RUC slice
###   deliberately and say so (standing banding rule).
### - [DC] = DATA-CONDITIONAL gate (rests on current-season / thin-evidence facts as
###   of 02/07/2026); on failure, run the failure triage below FIRST.

### GATE STATUS VOCABULARY (registered D14 03/07/2026 — carried query ASK 3a; the scoreboard
### emitted these words with no governance definition before now):
### - PASS / FAIL — the gate's scripted assertion holds / does not hold.
### - PENDING — the gate cannot yet be evaluated (its input stage, e.g. the PVC, is not built).
###   Not a red; not counted against shipping.
### - NOT-RUN — the gate needs a prerequisite harness run this session that has not happened yet
###   (e.g. B2 needs _gate1_wf.py). Re-run the prerequisite; not a verdict.
### - STRUCK — the gate was deliberately removed by Luke (A15). Not counted.
### - FEATURE — the gate is NO LONGER a pass/fail alarm: it was AMENDED into a PRICING FEATURE by
###   Luke. Exactly ONE gate carries this status: **B5** (the signed year-schedule floor). Luke's
###   D7 ruling retired B5-as-alarm and made the floor a pricing feature at the ev() boundary; the
###   FLOOR-SAVES TABLE (printed every gates-board run) is the NEW alarm surface — a saves-list that
###   grows unexpectedly is the signal the old red used to fire on. FEATURE does NOT mask a red: the
###   signal is not suppressed, it is relocated to a visible, printed list (mispricings stay VISIBLE,
###   never silently clamped), and the pure-lower-bound property (0 lowered, 0 non-ND moved) is
###   re-verified every run. If the saves-list ever needs a hard bound again, B5 returns to pass/fail
###   by Luke's ruling; until then FEATURE = "wired, visible, owner-ruled non-blocking."
### - HALT — the gate could not produce a verdict, or produced a hard breach: a raised
###   exception, a missing / unreadable input, a None / absent figure, or a bound breach.
###   A HALT is a RED. It is NEVER a skip and NEVER a pass. (Registered 2026-07-13, item-38 fix.)

### SUITE FAILURE SEMANTICS — AN ABSENT RESULT IS A FAILURE, NOT A PASS (registered
### 2026-07-13; owner ruling behind item 38/40; G-DATA halt-not-warn applied to the gate itself).
### Every gate block in ship_gates_check.py MUST produce a verdict or HALT. An exception, a
### missing input, an unreadable matrix, or a None result is turned into a named HALT carrying the
### gate's ID — it is caught, not swallowed. The suite EXITS NON-ZERO whenever any gate HALTs (or
### FAILs / ERRORs), AND a SILENT-GATE COMPLETENESS NET asserts that every gate in the board order
### produced a verdict at all — a gate that silently did not run (its block raised before recording
### anything) is caught by name and HALTS the suite. A run in which a binding gate prints nothing and
### the suite still reports PASS is the exact defect this closes (item 38: the cohort gate crashed
### with IndexError, printed nothing behind a `| tail -8` pipe, no exit code was checked, and PASS
### was reported anyway).
### THE STANDING INVOCATION RULE (BINDING, all future suites inherit it): NEVER pipe a gate's or the
### suite's output through `tail` / `head` (or any truncating filter) WITHOUT checking its exit code.
### `python3 ship_gates_check.py | tail -8` swallows the traceback AND drops the exit status — the
### item-38 signature. Correct forms: run without a pipe and read the whole log; or, if truncating,
### capture the status first — `python3 ship_gates_check.py > log 2>&1; rc=$?; tail log; exit $rc`
### (or `set -o pipefail` and test `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`). A green summary line is NOT a pass; the
### non-zero exit code is the authority.
### THE STANDING RULE EXTENDED TO THE HARNESS (BINDING, 2026-07-13 suite-hygiene; the invocation rule
### above governs the CLASS, not just the suite entry point): the rule is item-38's single instance; the
### disease is a class across every runner.
###   1. EVERY LIVE HARNESS RUNNER sets `set -o pipefail` (and, where it does not fight a deliberate
###      run-all-checks tally, `set -e` and `set -u`). A pipeline's exit status must be the FAILING
###      command's, never the last one's — `python3 <gate>.py | tail` returning tail's success is the
###      exact defect. A runner that tallies and prints a verdict (e.g. verify_restore.sh) makes its
###      EXIT CODE authoritative directly (`exit 1` on any fail) rather than relying on `set -e`.
###   2. NO RUNNER MAY MASK A CHECK. `<gate-or-export> ... || true` (or any swallow of a check's non-zero
###      status) is forbidden. If output must be truncated, capture the status FIRST:
###      `cmd > log 2>&1; rc=$?; tail log; exit $rc`.
###   3. A BAKE SCRIPT MUST NEVER PUBLISH OR PIN A BOARD IT DID NOT SUCCESSFULLY BUILD. The export's exit
###      status is captured and asserted BEFORE any copy, re-pin of `expected_boot.json`, or UI
###      re-extract; a non-zero export HALTs the bake with nothing published. (build_final_board.sh was
###      the worst instance — it masked a failing `rl_export.py` and re-pinned the stale board anyway.)
### RED-PATH TEST SEAM (`SGC_B1_MATRIX`) — FOR RED-PATH PROOFS ONLY; A RUN USING IT IS **NOT A
### CERTIFICATION** (fail-close, owner-ruled Option B, 2026-07-13). When set, B1 reads that matrix path
### INSTEAD of regenerating one, so the item-38 red paths (a breaching matrix HALTs; a missing/unreadable
### matrix HALTs) can be proven against the REAL suite and its REAL exit code. The seam exists SOLELY to
### exercise those red paths — it can NEVER produce a green certification:
###   • The board and the report are topped AND tailed with a loud banner:
###     "INJECTED MATRIX — THIS RUN IS NOT A CERTIFICATION."
###   • B1's verdict is stamped **INJECTED** (never a bare PASS) — in the board, the report, and
###     data/gates_snapshots/ — even on a clean, valid, non-breaching injected matrix. A breach or a
###     missing/garbage matrix still HALTs (HALT wins over INJECTED).
###   • The suite EXITS NON-ZERO whenever the seam is set, regardless of gate results. There is NO path by
###     which an injected run yields a green, zero-exit certification. (The meta/hash validation is
###     unchanged and still runs — this is an ADDITIONAL fail-close on top of it, not a weakening.)
### GATE/BAKE MODE HALTS IF THE SEAM IS SET: in a real bake or gate — signalled by `RL_CONFIG_MODE` set to
### `bake`/`gate` in the ambient environment — `config_manifest.enforce()` treats ANY set `SGC_*` variable
### as an unknown override and HALTS on line one (the same treatment `RL_*`/`PAR_*` overrides already get).
### A bake that even smells of an injected gate input dies before the engine loads. The proofs run in
### dev-shell mode (no ambient `RL_CONFIG_MODE`), so they still drive the suite — where B1 stamps INJECTED
### and the non-zero exit does the fail-close. UNSET in production ⇒ B1 regenerates the candidate exactly
### as before and the run is byte-identical to a seam-free run. Proofs live in
### session_2026-07-13/b1_conform/scripts/ (prove_injection_cannot_certify.py, prove_bake_door_bolted.py,
### prove_breach_halts.py, prove_silence_halts.py).

## SECTION A — LUKE'S NAMED CALLS (all confirmed)

A1.  Willem Duursma > Zeke Uwland.
A2.  Josh Ward below genuine producers: Ward < Paul Curtis AND Ward < Josh Weddle.
A3.  [DC] Connor Rozee: thin current season must not halve him — 2026 value >= 75%
     of 2025.
     [AMENDED 02/07/2026 (Luke, in writing, D7 directive; verbatim in CHANGELOG):
      threshold 0.80 -> 0.75, DATA-CAUSED — Rozee is out for the remainder of 2026
      (LTI register Section B, register-confirmed); Luke: "Happy to adjust Rozee
      to 75%". KNIFE-EDGE NOTE: the bar deliberately sits at reality's edge — the
      same design as A10/Curnow: the gate should fail the moment the engine
      over-punishes a thin season, not comfortably before. Evaluated PRE-LTI-layer
      (Luke, D4) unchanged.]
A4.  Harley Reid uncratered — Reid remains TOP 40 on the board by value.
A5.  Improvers not slashed: Jack Ginnivan > 1600, Jake Bowey > 2100,
     Nick Blakey > 2600.
     [Absolute SCAR floors — RE-BASE if the PVC re-levels the currency.]
A6.  Early-career rucks: years-1-3 RUC cohort median <= pick-matched MID cohort
     median at the same stage.
A7.  Position fixes stay fixed: Ryan Maric prices off a MID pole; Ed Langdon off a
     GDEF-dominant future. (Regression insurance vs silent reversion.)
A8.  [DC] Sam Berry > Elijah Tsatas by at least 2x.
     (Luke, 02/07/2026: fair on the data available today; explicitly expected to be
      re-ruled if Tsatas's evidence base materially changes — the engine SHOULD
      respond to new data. The exemplar data-conditional gate.)
A9.  Jack Ginnivan > Josh Ward.
A10. [DC] Charlie Curnow: 2026 value >= 70% of 2025.
A11. [DC] Playing beats sitting — named pairs: Jacob Farrow > Dylan Patterson;
     Sam Cumming > Dan Annable.
A12. [DC] Sitting is not unreasonably punished — named pairs: Tobie Travaglia >
     Christian Moraes; Josh Smillie > Patrick Retschko.
     (A11+A12 bracket sit-out retention from both directions; jointly define
      acceptable outcomes for the 1.19x/retention rework.)

### Pick-vs-player anchors (PVC-coupled; PENDING until the curve exists)
A13. Pick 1 line-ball (±20%) with EACH of George Wardlaw and Levi Ashcroft.
A14. Pick ~8 line-ball (±20%) with EACH of Trent Rivers, Zach Reid, Jase Burgoyne.

A15. STRUCK (Luke, 02/07/2026): the Robey-shape package anchor. Reason: "not all
     firsts are equal — pick 1 and pick 15 have wildly different value," and the
     Robey trade itself is not a good exemplar of reasonable value. Consequence
     logged: package-vs-star CONVEXITY is the suite's one known untested dimension
     → seeded as V_NEXT entry #1 (re-poseable with exact pick numbers post-PVC).

### Deliberate NON-GATES (disagreement bounded on purpose; shipping does not wait)
N1. Mid-career (years 3-5) Parish valuation — decider: the matched same-player cut.
N2. The years-4-6 peak LEVEL — not a gate until the matched cut runs.

## SECTION B — STRUCTURAL GATES
B1. Cohort growth law — CODE-CONFORMED to the JULY-8 CONSTRUCTION (owner-ruled
    2026-07-13, register v52; CONSTRAINTS v1.8 G-COHORT; amendment logged in
    CHANGELOG). THE GATE: population = incurve (type ∈ {ND,RD}) AND draft class
    2004-2020. For each class, the RAW class-year SUM of Vpath at each career year
    N (N=1 = end of calendar Yr1 = C+1). Average those raw sums UNWEIGHTED across
    the classes observed at N — one figure per year. Denominator = min(y1, y2).
    Test EACH of y4, y5, y6 INDIVIDUALLY against hard ≤ 1.30; a breach HALTS. The
    guide band 1.20-1.25 is ADVISORY (the margin is reported, never gated). NO
    per-class yr1=100 renormalisation, NO mean-of-ratios. First conformant
    measurement (store 340a7a32, this code-conform job): y1 69,840.0 · y2
    79,298.2 · y4 88,002.4 · y5 86,652.9 · y6 80,460.5 → 1.2601 / 1.2407 / 1.1521
    — PASS ×3 (identical to S2's independent shard at store b0c39d78).
    DEMOTED — THE INDEXED READING: the owner's 02/07 D5 form (per-class yr1=100
    renormalisation + mean-of-ratios) is SUPERSEDED by his 08/07 wording and
    13/07 confirmation ("no need to rescale… sounds silly"). It SURVIVES ONLY as
    B1's secondary, NON-GATING SHAPE diagnostic (peak position + pre-peak dip),
    structurally incapable of failing the build. Its historic headline
    126.8/125.2/116.1 is the INDEXED row — it must NEVER be printed or quoted as
    "the gate". The per-class curve table + the July-8 gated row + the demoted
    indexed row all print on every gates-board run (visibility without a gate).
    OBITUARY (retired 2026-07-13): session_2026-07-13/v2_9_continuation/scripts/
    cohort_gate_official.py — a second, drifting copy of this gate (a lookalike the
    single-source invariant forbids). Its "official" label predated the owner's
    13-July ruling; it computed the DEMOTED indexed reading; and at the item-20 job
    it was invoked with NO matrix path, raised IndexError, and silently no-oped
    while the suite reported PASS (item 38). DELETED (CORE rule 7 — delete, don't
    disable); full obituary in session_2026-07-13/b1_conform/. B1 in this frozen
    suite is now the ONE cohort gate.
B2. GATE-1: leakage ~0 (IS vs WF, tree-matched) + clean good/bust separation.
B3. Walk-forward book gates pass at the ship head.
B4. JS parity: Python and board JS byte-agree on the shipped board.
B5. AMENDED 02/07/2026 (Luke-ruled, in writing — text prepared D6, committed D7;
    verbatim ruling in CHANGELOG): B5 as a pass/fail ALARM is RETIRED. The signed
    year-schedule floor becomes a PRICING FEATURE at the ev() boundary:
    ev_final(p) = max(ev(p), floor_yrs(p) × draftval(p)), NATIONAL-DRAFT entrants
    only (MSD/SSP, delisted, retired and pickless players are never floored),
    floor_yrs = .45/.35/.28/.21/.13/.09 for yrs 1-6 and FLAT .05 for yrs 7+
    (TAIL VARIANT A — as signed; Luke's D7 ruling). The FLOOR-SAVES TABLE
    (player · club · yrs-in-system · raw ev · floor · saved-to · lift · register
    status) prints on EVERY gates-board run — the saves-list is the new alarm
    surface: a list that grows unexpectedly is the signal the old gate used to
    fire on; mispricings stay VISIBLE, never silently clamped. The pure-lower-bound
    property (0 lowered, 0 non-ND moved) is re-verified on every board run.
    [Generating rule retained for the schedule: floor ≈ 0.9 × smoothed clean p5
     (ND-only) — RE-BASE at the PVC stage when the draftval denominator re-levels,
     by re-running the generating rule (sibling of A5's SCAR-floor note; this
     in-file reminder Luke-approved in writing 02/07/2026).]
B6. No hard lines: value continuous across the games ramp (no step at the 6-game
    seam) AND monotone in evidence — more games at the same scoring rate is never
    worth less.

### D14 BY-CONSTRUCTION LAWS (Luke-authorized amendment, in writing, 03/07/2026 D14;
### verbatim rulings in CHANGELOG + docs/process/LUKE_RULINGS_LEDGER.md R12/R13; scripted
### PASS/FAIL in ship_gates_check.py, printed green every gates-board run). BOARD PATH only;
### the backtest/walk-forward machinery is exempt by Luke's ruling.
D14a. V0 same-boat law (Luke's amended law): same position × draft-age × recorded pick ⇒
      IDENTICAL starting V0* across draft years (max cross-draft dispersion = 0).
D14b. V0 order law: 0 within-cell (position × draft-age × draft-year) inversions under V0*
      (the D13 spot-guard TRANSFORM converted to this ASSERTION; obituary E5).
D14c. KPP retention floor (Owner Override O1, docs/process/OWNER_OVERRIDES.md): the KPP
      sit-out retention surface = max(KPP, nonKPP) is depth-monotone (never gains by sitting).

## SECTION C — BASELINE GATE (complexity must earn its keep)
C1. Ship head beats the NAIVE BASELINE (last-2-season avg + simple age curve +
    position multipliers) on the walk-forward book headline metrics.
C2. Ship head beats the ORIGINAL V1 pick model on the same metrics.
    (If either fails: stop and re-scope before the PVC.)

## PROCESS
- FREEZE: on Luke's word; committed to the repo; build scripts every line into
  ship_gates_check.py, run at each candidate head and mandatorily at any bake.
- FAILURE TRIAGE (Luke's rule, 02/07/2026 — a live engine must respond to live
  data): on any gate failure, the build attributes the cause BEFORE anything blocks:
    * ENGINE-CAUSED (a code/calibration/store change moved the value) → the gate
      blocks the bake per normal rules.
    * DATA-CAUSED (new real-world results changed the facts the gate rests on,
      e.g. Tsatas returns and performs) → NOT a block; escalate to Luke for an
      uphold-or-amend ruling, logged in CHANGELOG per the amendment process.
    * AMBIGUOUS → decompose (isolate engine change vs data change) before either
      path; no undecomposed attribution.
  [DC]-tagged gates get the triage question first by default.
- V_NEXT.md: every post-freeze read/gripe lands there, dated, untouched until the
  suite passes. Entry #1 (seeded at freeze): package-vs-star convexity anchor,
  re-poseable with exact picks once the PVC exists.
- AMENDMENT: Luke-only, in writing, reason logged in CHANGELOG.
- Red gates at freeze time are allowed and expected (e.g., A3/A10 pre-decay-fix):
  a red gate is the definition of what a fix must achieve before shipping.
- ENVIRONMENT: gates evaluated in the canonical build environment per the values
  policy (byte-exact within environment; see BAKE_CHECKLIST).
