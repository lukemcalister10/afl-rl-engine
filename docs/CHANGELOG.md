#     Reconcile + confirm + doc-hygiene; defects FLAGGED not fixed (Luke's call). Three findings:
#  B1 — STEP-3 DIALS NOT WIRED (price-moving FLAG). The live ev() path reads the PROVISIONAL line-26 scalars
#     (_merged_recover.py:26 `PROVEN_N=4; FLAT_TOL=3.0; LDECAY=0.40`), read at L31-32/35/41-42/74. The step-3
#     CALIBRATED values recorded in the 2026-06-29 "STEP 3 — CLOSED" entry were NEVER applied to code — that
#     entry's own "engine UNCHANGED" confirms it; only 3-B POLE re-level was applied (the e0ac9c37 bump).
#       LDECAY : live 0.40 single  | calibrated KEY 0.40 / GEN 0.35 / MID+RUC 0.225  (GEN+MID+RUC running too slow a decay)
#       FLAT_TOL: live 3.0 single  | calibrated KEY 10.3 / GEN 12.0 / MID+RUC 14.0   (3-4x gap; proven-flat hold rarely fires -> tracks current level)
#       PROVEN_N: live 4 + c=n/4   | calibrated per-branch SURFACE (above~0/near~2.8/below-young 2D), which also REPLACES the c=n/4 shrinkage (L42) — unwired
#       POLE_RAMP: live 22 == calibrated 22 (OK, not in question).
#     The calibrated values (0.225/10.3/12.0/14.0/2.8) are ABSENT from engine code; no per-group dict, no 2nd path.
#     CONSEQUENCE: all of STEP 4 (book, backtest, no-games, ruck work) was validated on PROVISIONAL step-1 dials,
#     not the calibrated step-3 surface. When the dials are wired (Luke's go) step-4 numbers shift -> re-validate. NOT FIXED.
#  B2 — DELETE-CANDIDATES confirmed NO live caller (live ev = raw_ev*iso_corr + staleness; _merged_recover uses rd only for
#     REPL_DROP L56, never the value fns). All audit INERT tags CORRECT (none had a live caller):
#       B8 KAPPA/SCONV/LOWBASE (rl_model:266) + comp() (:268, a no-op `return v`); B13 out_tilt (:614, "CUT cont.21" :656) /

#       MA.value() pedestal + dist_value repricer + redesign_value + reliability/own_band blend + par_redesign forks = superseded
#       par-router, unreached by live ev. -> all delete-candidates for a later BATCHED cleanup (Luke sign-off; not deleted now).
#       NOTE: SHRINK_K lives in par_build.py:25 (+ diagnostic print :199), not the cited dist_redesign :122-123 — minor loc correction.
#  B3 — CHANGELOG SHIPPING GAP. CHANGELOG.md EXISTS in the workspace (769 lines) but was NOT included in the step-4 checkpoint
#     tarball -> the audit (on the tarball) correctly found none. Action: ship CHANGELOG in every checkpoint henceforth.
#     FORWARD CONVENTION ADOPTED: each constant change / derivation gets an entry = what, value, and (derivation | "Luke choice + date").
#     Price-moving (C) rationale recorded as each is confirmed/re-derived downstream; no retroactive archaeology now.

#       option->prod +459; non-debutants 191 hold option 201 but zeroed. The +57% STEP is mostly mechanical debut-revelation,
#       NOT option re-pricing -> year-1-step target FAR below +57%; lift MUST be debut-timing-weighted (don't lift a 2-yr-late

#     D (i) n=437. (ii) window widenable to 2008-2021 (14 cohorts all yr5<=2026); 2014-19 was conservative -> widen to thicken

#     UPPER-BAND (p70-p90) re-centre, NOT a body/median move -- for the crash positions p50 is correctly sub-replacement and
#     prices ~0 wherever placed (GEN_FWD p50 54.6), the gap is p70/p90 below realized; built as a median move it does NOTHING
#     for GEN_FWD. (B) is HIGH-PRECISION (convex floor: 2-pt p90 miss = hundreds of SCAR, GEN_FWD 48 SCAR/avg-pt) -> p70/p90
#     targets landed on realized precisely per position. 6 GEN_DEF anchor-movers: DO include top-pick producers (Hayden Young
#     pk7, Wanganeen-Milera pk11, Max Holmes pk21 -- GEN_DEF draftees who became elite mids), BUT keying doesn't move THEIR

#     -> healthy end UNDISTURBED, shift is all at the crash end; REINFORCES drafted-keying (retains positional-flexibility upside).
#     FIRST-ORDER SIZING: aggregate yr0 must reach ~464 (from 326, +42% mean, DISTRIBUTIONAL by pick/pos toward E[outcome|pick,pos],
#     NOT flat) to bring yr0->yr1 +57% -> <=10%. TWO FORKS for the sizing pass (Luke's calls): (1) (A)/(B) apportionment of the

#     Script rl_after/_traj_keying_repl.py; full account in MEASUREMENT_cohort_trajectory_2026-06-28.md. Resolved the two gates:
#     (A) GEN_DEF ANCHOR-KEYING (drafted vs current): only 6 movers; drafted-keyed (principled cohort) p50 0.75 deep-pick crash,
#     current-keyed p50 0.30 (median crashes too) -> keying shifts magnitude not direction; GEN_DEF STAYS in body lever, deep-pick,
#     pick-resolved. (B) REPL-HARDNESS: v_at_peak floor is a legit steep convexity (~30-48 SCAR/avg-pt, near-0 at repl-8), NOT a
#     bug; crash positions' realized mass straddles a high replacement so value is UPPER-band (p70/p90) concentrated -> the body
#     re-centre for GEN_FWD/KEY_DEF/deep-GEN_DEF is an upper-band move (not p50), precise+pick-resolved (GEN_FWD 48 SCAR/avg-pt
#     worst); KEEP REPL_DROP uniform -3, no per-position re-scope. DISTRIBUTIONAL SIZING LOCKED: lift realizers' option toward
#     realized E[outcome], hold bust mass ~0, let aggregate fall out -- NOT flat "double yr0" (44% of yr0 = eventual busts ->
#     flat lift worsens the drop); composition-safety = taper-safety (busts price ~0 every state). Live-pole carries all three:
#     taper-matched ~70/yr + pick-scaled 151-deep/357-realizer + distributional/bust-weighted. LEVER MAP locked: (A) live-pole

#     (1) GATING NUMBER: yr0->yr1 on the AGGREGATE-SUM-WITH-BUSTS-AS-ZEROS basis (non-debuted-by-yr-t=0) = +56.6% (~+57%, NOT
#     the earlier +82%; +82 had no yr1 bust-zero). 191/437 (44%) non-debuted at yr1. Curve total SCAR: yr0 142267 -> yr1 222826
#     (+57%) -> 304389 (+37%) -> 348401 (+14%) -> 382339 (+10%) -> 383003. Gates the <=5-10% tolerance; sits 6-11x above it.
#     Sizing: aggregate yr0 option must ~DOUBLE (326 -> ~600+) to flatten, and the lift must be DISTRIBUTIONAL (44% of yr0 option
#     is eventual non-debutants who drop to 0 at yr1). (2) TAPER ROBUST off-survivor: state discount split REALIZERS [357->0 smooth],
#     NON-REALIZERS [~0 at every state, discount ~2 -> the pole has NOTHING to over-lift on busts], DEEP pk>=25 [151->0 smooth].
#     => live-pole must be PICK-SCALED (151 deep vs 357 realizer) + DISTRIBUTIONAL (option, not flat per-player bonus) + taper-matched;

#     rl_app_data.json reproduce Luke's reads; board~=engine within 10%). Full account in MEASUREMENT_cohort_trajectory_2026-06-28.md.
#     (1) GEN_DEF CONFLICT resolved with a twist: first-pass v_opt used a coarse 3-pick-band -> false-flat 837 across pk5-15
#     (the wide-bin artifact). Pick-KERNEL v_opt (H=0.40 log-pick): named young GEN_DEFs are HEALTHY (Patterson pk5 1.25,
#     X.Taylor 0.90, Kyle 0.84, O.Taylor 0.90, Carmichael 0.99) -- NOT crashed. BUT the 2014-19 GEN_DEF cohort is BIMODAL
#     (mean 0.55, p25 0.02, p50 0.75, 49%<0.30); the crash is the DEEP-pick young GEN_DEFs (pk>=25 mean 0.44) on the GEN_FWD-
#     style value-floor knife-edge. So the 0.63 mean DID mask a sub-cluster (Luke right) -- deep-pick, not the named ones;
#     "GEN_DEF tail-dominated" was a mean artifact; body re-centre must target deep-pick young. (2) STATE DISCOUNT is a SMOOTH
#     taper (yr0 269->yr1 192->yr2 131->yr3 56->yr4 12, ~70/yr) NOT a step -> a live-pole removing it state-by-state compresses
#     the +57% yr0->yr1 surge to ~+18% gentle-positive WITHOUT a post-yr0 cliff; CONSTRAINT: U28-D's taper must MATCH this decay.
#     (3) CLEAN pick-monotonicity breach: Sweid pk25 (yr0 294) < Matthews pk30 (yr0 350), both GFWD/0g/draft-age18 -- the
#     cond_prior quantile-GBR band is non-monotone in pick (Matthews' band > Sweid's at q30-q90); held-equal guard blind (differ
#     in pick). Needs a pick-isotonic guard on cond_prior, separate from U28-D. Cross-position orderings (Nairn>Carmichael,
#     Dovaston>X.Taylor/Kyle) confounded by position scale+games, flagged not clean. 71/29 rankings hold; bust-zeroing recut

#     project above pk14; Emmett RUC pk27 = 2.05×PVC) — tiny ruck sample, GBR can't fit; proposed fix = running floor
#     from top of draft (down-only). VERIFIED implemented: censoring fix (resolved_cut=2021) + level+tenure prior.
#     FALSE ALARM (correctly not fixed): GEN_FWD "over-projects" = test-set censoring artifact. Corrected per-position

  0.72), tenure, _lvl_eff (games+recency wtd level x reliability-shrink, RL_LEVEL_RAMP 14), _age_asof]. Smooth (kills game-6
  cliff), MSD/long-gap aware, position-aware age. No separate blend (conditioning subsumes it). In-dist calib 11/30/49/70/90.
  _lvl_asof kept LEGACY. Backup conditional_prior.py.pre_rebuild_bak.
- RUCK TAX (dist_redesign.py, RL_RUCK_TAX=0.25, RUCKS-ONLY, Luke-approved): ev -= 0.25*max(0, ev - _realised); _realised =
  redesign of a PROVEN clone at the player's _lvl_eff (_tax=False recursion guard). Self-targeting; catches Conway (1293->951).
- PER-GROUP REPL (dist_redesign.py): RL_REPL_DROP_FWD=4 (KEY_FWD+GEN_FWD, lifts elite KPFs), RL_REPL_DROP_OTHER=2. Was global -3.
- +25% CAP SKIPPED (Luke); DEMO FLOOR OUT; BRODIE x0.5 kept; pre-debut still engine MA.value PVC path.
- 805 before/after: AFL_REDESIGN_805_rebuild_2026-06-24.xlsx (+ _v column, By Position). verify_anchors.py added.
- Anchors: Daicos 6938, Bont 3096, Petracca 3154, McCarthy 2539, J.Cameron 1196, Gawn 2522, Madden 1395, Conway 951,
  McAndrew 1606, Uwland 1048, Keane 2215, Bice 693, Sharman _v 310. Redesign board +9-28% above _v (REPL drop + uncapped upside).
- NEXT (only step left): engine wire-in -> value() + JS parity (incl. ruck tax + proven-clone realised) + HTML don't-ship.

## cont.(23) 2026-06-23 — VERIFIED cont.22 · by() CRASH FIX · ROSTER→805 · WALK-FORWARD HARNESS · FLOOR SUPERSEDED → DISTRIBUTION PRICING
- VERIFIED cont.22: Sharman=310 correct; §9 as-of contamination RESOLVED & PROVEN (stress test 0/788 drift) — cont.21 had the polarity backwards (1147 was the stale-cache artefact).
- FIXED by() None-guard (rl_model.py L60): cont.22's DOB fold-in wrote `_by=None` for ~302 records → `.get(key,default)` returned None → crashed `_age_at` on every backtest. Shipped board was safe (0 active affected). Guard: `p.get('_by') or (p['year']-18)`.
- ROSTER → 805 (active-17 RESOLVED): set force_active for 17 undebuted-but-rostered players in both masters + JSON. 805 is manually-maintained ground truth, no auto-inactive. Backups *.bak_pre_active17.
- WALK-FORWARD HARNESS built (forward_valuation/walk_forward_harness.py): in-sample-leakage CONFIRMED (106%→96%); β calibrated on 14 clean cohorts (0.85 mean96/min90, 0.87 comfortable, 0.90 hot). Sanity passed (2024/25 wf≈in-sample).
- JS PARITY root-caused: ~189/788 = out_tilt cut (cont.21) never ported to `_engine_block_v23.js` L79; cont.22's DOB/cache changes flow BAKED so don't break parity; "0/785" gate was stale (cont.14). Board DO-NOT-SHIP. Fix parked (remove `*outTilt` L79).
- BACKTEST regenerated on current engine (AFL_cohort_backtest_MASTER_2003-2025.xlsx) — 2020 cohort 0.96→0.54 over yr1-6 confirms write-down works. Mature-age class CLOSED (Luke cleared candidates; Bramble was the only real one).
- ⚠️ FLAT FLOOR (U21-1) SUPERSEDED: Luke's per-player audit of the floor preview — it compresses young-gun ceilings (Willem pick-1 86avg projects only 101.6) + props stalled high-picks uniformly (Clark pick-8 @41=half-replacement floored 800; Zane 1372); not-playing protects pedigree. Root cause: point-estimate + flat pedigree prop, no variance/trajectory.
- DISTRIBUTION PRICING (U21-4) is now the next build, spec'd WHOLE in DISTRIBUTION_PRICING_SPEC.md: pedigree=prior, performance updates by gap-magnitude × persistence; value=E[v] over freehand quantile bands (conditioned on pedigree+form), uniform pedigree-prior shrinkage by local data thinness, top-of-draft trend extrapolation (PVC loclin/parametric technique), harness-calibrated, replaces β·PVC+cvx+runway+decay. AWAITING Luke's go to build.

## cont.(22) 2026-06-23 — SOURCE-OF-TRUTH UNIFICATION + DOB LOAD + peak_est CACHE FIX
- Rebuilt afl_master_db.xlsx FROM the live JSON (was stale) → faithful superset; compiler rl_build_data.py round-trips everything (scoring from 2005, +cols dob/phantom/double_count/pvc_exclude/eyr). Proven compile(master)==JSON for 2654/2656 (intended diffs only).
- DOBs folded into the SOURCE (844 incl Shane Tuck 1981-12-24) → flow to _by/_bd; real ages not 18-at-draft default.
- peak_est CACHE FIX: _pe_clear() @ L812 — peak_est memoised at SCALE while pickless players held placeholder _eff; pickless now price on real pick-equivalent. Sharman 1147→310. ~53 pickless corrected. Backups *.bak_pre_unify_2026-06-23.
- Eddie Betts/Elijah Ware→2004 RD #1/#2; Monahan key fix; 40 removed players archived (restorable). ⚠️ Left OPEN (now fixed cont.23): JS parity regressed; by() crash latent.

## cont.(21-cont) 2026-06-23 — PEDESTAL RE-DERIVATION prototyped+validated (not shipped) + Bramble DB fix + in-sample-leakage finding
- Luke eyeballed young board post-out_tilt-cut, found the pedestal ratio PVC[pick]*(peak/base)^2.2 INVERTS quality (Uwland GEN_DEF pick2 > Willem MID pick1). Proof: Uwland as-MID=2126 vs as-GEN_DEF=3266.
- FIX (prototyped, NOT wired): floor = seasons_decay × runway(age) × max(value_of_peak, β×PVC[pick]), β=0.85. Monotone in pick+projection. runway(age)=clamp((28-age)/6,0,1) = mature-age fix (Blakiston). Code: forward_valuation/pedestal_rederivation_prototype.py. Doc: PEDESTAL_REDERIVATION.md.
- β calibrated to year-1 cohort retention ≥90% (HARD constraint). β=0.40 (set by eye) bled 2025 to 64% (establishment-P redux, caught by Luke). 0.85 holds (2024=92%,2025=90%).
- IN-SAMPLE LEAKAGE finding: old cohorts backtest ~110% (v4 trained on their careers = hindsight), only 2024/25 genuine out-of-sample (~94%). NOT survivorship/composition (both ruled out, verified). Honest benchmark = ~94%; only 2 clean cohorts for calibration.
- BRAMBLE DB FIX: year 2023→2020 (2020 SSP), full 6-season scoring re-entered, games=91. Now production-bound (was phantom rookie-pedestal 232). Backup rl_model_data.json.cont21bak. NOT yet rebuilt into board.
- OPEN: build first-order walk-forward harness (~14 clean cohorts + verify leakage) OR lock β=0.85 + wire in. Mature-age DATA class (Blakiston+) still needs cleaning.

## cont.(21) 2026-06-23 — FULL PEDESTAL AUDIT + out_tilt CUT (rebuilt, parity-verified)
- Audited every inherited value() mechanism (work? how? adds value? double-counts v4?). PEDESTAL_AUDIT.md = canonical verdict table + test numbers.
- BLAST RADIUS: 63% of active are production-bound (v4-clean); only the young 37% are pedestal-bound (old machinery). 
- out_tilt CUT (line 656): redundant w/ v4 — corr(sig,realised−v4)=−0.05, marginal R²=+0.001 (form double-count, same as removed survival()). Was ±300–470 on young; over-lifts down / over-drags up; proven untouched.
- KEPT (audited): tenure decay (essential — makes proven price on production), young-key-pos floor (1/31 overlap w/ explicit floor, not redundant), los_decay (0→1g continuous), relative^2.2 (near-optimal), lens_tilt (inert on bal), capt_prem, _playsig. realized_cv deduped.
- cvx KEEP-FOR-NOW flagged: premise fails (corr(cvx,realised−point)=+0.02) but not a double-count, capped +25%, mostly inert, net-narrows a real −139 young under-pricing. Defer to distribution-pricing piece; don't amputate in isolation.
- Rebuilt (4-step). Parity board=point×cvx ✓, surv=1/P=1 all 788 ✓, proven unchanged ✓. Distribution-range NOT re-injected (board 0.94MB; re-inject when hover feature built).

## cont.(19) 2026-06-22 — LEARNED PROJECTION v2->v4 VALIDATED + forward target + DOB load
- Learned projection replaces the rigid peak_est blend. v2 (career-peak target) R² 0.29->0.46; v4 (FORWARD-realised target, current year counts w/ completeness weight) forward R² 0.43-0.50. SURVIVORSHIP fixed all positions (+75..130% -> ±7%) via bust-inclusive prior; KONDOGIANNIS +7.3 -> ~0. peak_model_v4.pkl, build_peak_model_v4.py.
- Forward target retarget removed the v2/v3 pedestal-explosion (Darcy +282% -> breakouts now correctly RAISE value, Treacy +83% YoY on his 104 breakout). Current year counts, weighted by season progress (Luke directive).
- DOB load: 40 retired 2003-07 mature-age DOBs + 808 active from xlsx, composite name|debut key (two Sam Fishers / Alwyn Daveys / Callum Browns). dob_corrected.json (848), load_dobs.py. Needle: marginal for R², good for individual mature-age correctness.
- CORRECTION: the pedestal is a YOUNG-player floor (value=max(prod,pedestal); decays to 0 by ~season 5) — NOT the proven-gun driver. Proven-gun "markdown" vs old engine = v4 dropping the old `level/frac(age,peak)^0.88` age-extrapolation, calibrated to realised outcomes. Pedestal re-derivation belongs to the young/unproven floor work.
- OPEN/GATED on Luke "build": re-derive pedestal for unproven floor + position-aware starting value + no-evidence decay; parallel before/after workbook; distribution pricing; integrate into rl_model.py (deletes ×P_establish + rigid blend; redo JS parity).

## cont.(18) 2026-06-22 — CONTROL built (establishment-P OFF, backtested) + bias audit
- CONTROL = engine w/ establishment-P off, backtested whole DB. Projection R² 0.287 (RUC 0.011 random). Found BIAS #1 survivorship (universal +75..130% late-pick overshoot) + BIAS #2 Kondogiannis (early-establisher under-projected 7.3). Architecture decision: keep value pipeline, replace only the projection. CONTROL_metrics.json, control.py, the byCohort backtest workbook (+ Cohort vs Draft summary, active-window masking, 2005 scoring start).

## cont.(17) 2026-06-22 — Forward Valuation PIVOT (D+ bug)
- D+ value-assembly was structurally wrong (draft pick a permanent multiplier -> dragged proven late-pick guns; hidden by cohort average, caught per-player). Engine values NOT ground truth; reads + realised outcomes are. New direction: PV of predicted realised future production read through INTERSECTIONS. FORWARD_MODEL_V2_DIRECTION.md.

## SESSION cont.(16) — FORWARD VALUATION MODEL (v5/variant D) + BIRTHDAYS + ROSTER CLEANUP (2026-06-22)
**Design + prototype + DATA only — the LIVE ENGINE/BOARD is UNCHANGED** (the Forward Valuation Model is NOT yet integrated into `rl_model.py`; the shipped HTML still runs establishment‑P). The **data‑of‑record DID change** (`rl_after/rl_model_data.json` 2653→2656 rows; retirements + 3 adds + dates).

**FORWARD VALUATION MODEL — the establishment‑P successor (prices bust risk ONCE; replaces the `×P_establish` gating that caused the cohort cliff / old 0c).** Standalone prototype + spec in `forward_valuation/`. Components: position‑tilted anchor (TILT) · stage‑bar performance update with reliability‑faded asymmetry · survival‑hold (band × POSADJ) blended by arrival weight · convex `cv()` captaincy premium · smooth gaussian runway · leak‑free forward‑decay projection.
- **v5 = variant D shipped in the prototype (3 changes over v4):** (1) smooth runway (gaussian, no birthday cliffs); (2) position‑conditioned survival POSADJ (RUC ×2.20 / KEY_DEF ×1.89 by yr5 vs MID ×0.85 — late developers retain); (3) smooth game cutoff `gw(g)=clip((g−2)/8,0,1)` blended with the survival hold (no 8‑game discontinuity).
- **VALIDATED (ND 2006‑2020):** cohort yr1 102% → yr4 105% → yr6 105% → yr10 85% (no cliff, prime ROI lift, clean aging); forward bias **+0%/−0%** all‑players; 2020 dud crop flagged 86%.
- **DEFERRED: distribution / upside premium** — built (variant C, youth +8% / proven +2%) but double‑counts PVC's baked‑in upside → runs ~10% hot. Needs recentering around the cohort average + ceiling‑aware (asymmetric) bands. **Target (Luke):** yr1 cohort ≥90%, a defined peak ~110% at some stage, ~95% avg fine, NO scripting; reach ~110% via the discount/convexity lever + the redistributive premium.

**BIRTHDAYS** (`forward_valuation/AFL_Player_Birthdays.xlsx`, 809 rows ≈ current AFL list): matched 799/1016 active. **Pedigree = draft cohort, not age** (age → runway only). Applied full DOBs (`_bd`) to the 7 corrected + 3 new + Monahan + Callum M. Brown. **PENDING: bulk‑load all 799 `_bd` + wire continuous age into the runway.** File error found (Ben Murphy DOB 2027) + name collisions (Max King = young Maxwell King; Callum Brown = active Callum M. Brown) documented.

**ROSTER CLEANUP (data‑of‑record; active pool 1016→805 ≈ the file's 809):** retired 214 stale delisted players (`forward_valuation/delisted_candidates.csv`); added Berry (KEY_DEF) / Carr (RUC) / Bourke (GEN_DEF) — pickless post‑draft signings, end of 2025; Watkins `_by` 2001→2000; Monohan→Monahan kept active; two Callum Browns confirmed SEPARATE (active Callum M. Brown + retired older one), not a dup.

## SESSION 2j cont.(14c) — FILE-STRUCTURE CLEANUP + DATA CONTRACT + 3rd/4th AUDITS (2026-06-21)
**Structural + documentation only — engine/board UNCHANGED** (board md5 27cc6fb5, HTML 348af1d6, parity 0/785, re-verified by clean-room rebuild). Data was already unified: `rl_model.py` reads ONLY `rl_model_data.json` + `params.json` + `rl_passmark.json`, and that DB already spans draft years **2003–2025** (the PVC builds from them) — nothing to "fold in".
- **Root de-cluttered:** removed ~15 exact-duplicate files (8 scripts == `rl_after/`, `recalc.py` == `xlsx_scripts/`, 3 xlsx == `deliverables_2h/`, 2 `.pre*.json` == `backups/`, and a duplicate `xlsx_scripts/` tree); archived 9 unique derived artifacts into new **`rl_workspace/archive/`** (+ its README); moved `rl_app_data.pre331.json` into `backups/`. Tarball root is now just `START_HERE.md` + `rl_workspace/` + the `rl_after`/`rl_build` symlinks.
- **Data contract documented** in README + START_HERE (engine input = those 3 files; everything else is derived/snapshot/tooling/docs). Corrected the stale HANDOVER "BACKUPS … OUTSIDE bundle" line.
- **3rd + 4th (cold-start) audits, same session:** fixed README nav (`cont.(9)`→top-block language), the README build recipe (had been single-column, now full dual-column SCAR+VOR), added the root `START_HERE.md` signpost, corrected 3 stale anchors (Moyle 850 / O'Brien 624 / Perez 47) and the `compute.py` O'Brien apostrophe. Full detail in `journal.txt`.

## SESSION 2j cont.(14c) — JS-ENGINE PARITY: ESTABLISHMENT-P + BRODIE NOW IN THE BROWSER (2026-06-21)
**`_engine_block_v23.js` + `rl_export.py` changed; HTML rebuilt. Board values UNCHANGED (Python identical) — only the in-browser recompute + 3 baked fields changed.** Closes the A1 JS-parity gap. **Parity gate (`node _rl_parity.js`): 0/785 mismatches** (max diff 1 = the existing ±1 convexity-rounding).

**Ported into the JS `valuePlayer` (now mirrors Python `value()`):**
1. **Establishment-P gating.** `P` baked per player (`round(P_estab(p),6)`, 1.0 = established). GATE 1: pedestal decay floored — `ped*relative*surv*min(pedDecay,P)`. GATE 2 (PROD_GATE='blenddemo'): `prod_full = ⅓·prod_full + ⅔·(P·prod_full + (1−P)·gfloor)`, `gfloor=max(pedestal, cred·prodFloor + (1−cred)·pedestal)`, `cred=min(1,games/50)`. **P is FROZEN** (computed at the player's real draft-cohort position) — Luke's call: bust rate is a fixed draft-cohort property, not the SuperCoach toggle; toggling position must NOT rewrite it (and the heavy alternative — porting the whole `pgrid` surface to JS — buys nothing here).
2. **Brodie cut.** `brodieBase` baked (the signal minus the RUC bit); JS applies `if(brodieBase && grpOf(p)!=='RUC') res*=0.5` so the RUC exemption fires LIVE — toggle Brodie to ruck and the cut correctly turns off (tested: MID 472 → RUC 1683 → back 472).
3. **0-game in-window P.** Baked a new `pedOnly` flag = Python's pure-pedigree condition (`_unplayed and (debut>AGE_REF or _pedonly)`); the JS no-P branch now keys off `pedOnly`, so genuine pre-debut prospects stay pure-pedigree but IN-WINDOW 0-game players (Patterson, Smillie) correctly get `unpl_eq·P`. (`unpl` stays as-is for the pool filter + UNPLAYED tag.)
4. **Relative-floor (young key-pos) — pre-existing JS gap, also folded in.** The JS recompute never had the v3.4 relative-floor; surfaced by the parity gate (25 young key-pos players off). Ported the `(RUC/KEY_FWD/KEY_DEF & age≤22 & relative<1) → relative += sc·(1−relative)` block. Not part of the P/Brodie ask, but required for true 0/785 parity.

**Dual-engine note (corrects an earlier doc claim):** there is NO second engine copy — `_rl_parity.js` was already canonicalised to LOAD `_engine_block_v23.js`, so this was a one-file change. **Position-toggle non-idempotency (old PARKED §3): tested CLEAN** — every round-trip returns exactly (Bailey J. Williams 1918→1372→1918, etc.).

**Baked fields added to `rl_app_data.json`:** `P`, `brodieBase`, `pedOnly`. HTML 1.07M→1.14M (per-player fields). **A1 JS parity is CLOSED.**

## SESSION 2j cont.(14b) — THIN-PRIOR RECENCY FIX SHIPPED (2026-06-21)
**rl_model.py `level_demo` changed; HTML rebuilt (785, dual-column).** Closes the thin-prior item (was UNRESOLVED/PARKED §8). Two changes, both general (no gating):
1. **RECENCY-FLOOR (the inversion fix).** Floor `conf` at the recent season's share of the recency-weighted game mass: `_pmass=Σ 0.60^(ly-y)·min(gm,18)` over prior seasons; `_cfloor=min(lg,18)/(min(lg,18)+_pmass)`; `conf=max(conf,_cfloor)` in the improving branch. Guarantees a more-recent game never weighs LESS per game than an older one (more, with recency decay). Fixes Alger's case: 4g-2025 vs 4g-2026 was weighting 2025 higher (0.55 vs 0.45) → now 2026 0.62 vs 2025 0.38. Lift-only.
2. **MERGE (the dropped-cameo fix).** A sub-3-game CURRENT-year cameo folds into the most-recent qualifying season (kept as that season's games): `la=(la*lg+ca*cg)/(lg+cg); lg+=cg`. So 1-2 game current-year results COUNT (up or down) instead of being dropped by the `>=3` filter. Transient by design — once the live season hits 3 games it becomes its own qualifying season and the games pull back out.
**IMPACT (vs the cont.14 board):** level moves are small (±1-3 pts); the larger value swings are the convex curve at the top, not the merge over-reading. Gulden 4296→4476 (2g@112.5), Day 2230→2386 (2g@102.5); Rozee 3048→2848 (2g@80, slow start counts), Taylor 1607→1453 (2g@48.5). Intended thin cohort: Alger 120→124, Ramsden 250→267, Busslinger 542→549. Stars (Sheezel/Daicos/Dangerfield) and McAndrew unchanged; Brodie 476→473. Net board immaterial. Decision (Luke): apply to ALL players, not just non-established — the 2 games are real evidence, the level move is small, and it self-corrects as the season fills. **Thin-prior is now CLOSED (no remaining broad-fix item).**

## SESSION 2j cont.(14) — ESTABLISHMENT-P + BRODIE + CAPTAINCY PORTED TO THE BOARD (2026-06-21)
**rl_model.py + pgrid.py + compute.py changed; HTML rebuilt (dual-column SCAR+VOR, active 785).** The three compute.py-only mechanisms that never reached the shipped board are now LIVE on it (single source of truth = rl_model.py). Backups: /home/claude/{pgrid.py.bak,compute.py.bak}; this-session pre-port state in rl_model.py.bak.pre_pathways.

**1. ESTABLISHMENT-P GATING — now LIVE on the board.** The consuming machinery (`PROD_GATE='blenddemo'` + `decay_eff=min(decay,Pz)` in `value()`) was already in rl_model.py but INERT because `P_HOOK=None`. Ported the SURFACE (`pgrid.Praw`+`mat_mult`) + the per-pick/per-pathway establishment prior (`_pick_curveP`/`_grpoffP`/`pick_prior`/`_pathpr`, PAVA-monotone) + `P_estab` from compute.py into rl_model.py (after PICKEQ, before the overrides → priors build on REAL types), and set `P_HOOK=P_estab`. P personalises bust risk: a not-yet-established player's pedigree pedestal + production are weighted by P(establish); established players P=1 (untouched). **Board effect: 264/785 move, ALL down (median −207).** Stars at P=1 unchanged (Daicos 7487, Sheezel 9237); late-pick rucks tempered (Xerri 8577→5694, Moyle 3479→844, Madden 2576→693); high-pedigree prospects gated (the intended "establishment discounts the draft prior"). This is Luke's DESIGNED bust-rate fix, not an age band-aid (which would double-count).

**2. BRODIE ROLE-RELIABILITY CUT — now LIVE.** `brodie_sig(p)` (non-RUC, `seasons>=5`, NOT a recent starter, NEVER durable, `level_now>=80`) → `res*=0.5` inside `value()`, so it flows to point + convex (via proj_value) + backward columns. **Will Brodie 1443→476.** Catch set this build = {Will Brodie}.

**3. CAPTAINCY BAR 108.0→107.4** (`CAPT_THRESH`, rl_model.py ~243; M6, last-5 rank-25 from the unbiased upload).

**4. PRESENT-IDENTITY OVERRIDES — value-side now complete.** The relocation to rl_model.py (cont.13) plus gating means McAndrew lands at his intended **3051→1755** (the override's designed partner: SSP-2024 anchor + P=0.28 gating). Keane 1795 (P=1), Perez 46 (P=0.21), Hall-Kahan 120 (P=0.31).

**5. pgrid.py DECOUPLED.** The port created a circular import (rl_model→pgrid→rl_model) that broke under rl_export's `exec()`. Rewrote pgrid: removed `import rl_model`; surface now built via `pgrid.build(data,GRP,debut)` (caller injects data); `mat_mult(ea,G)` takes entry-age as an arg. Zero rl_model dependency → no cycle, works in the exec path. Verified: VOR + SCAR exports both clean (785).

**6. compute.py SINGLE-SOURCED.** Removed the duplicated surface/P_estab/brodie/override/`P_HOOK=` blocks; now aliases `MA.established/grp3/P_estab/brodie_sig`. Removed the redundant Brodie cut in its `after` block (rl_model.value now cuts → was about to double-count). Validated: Brodie 476 (single cut), McAndrew 1755, Xerri 5694, Sheezel 9237.

**SHIPPED HTML (rebuilt):** active 785, v_vor 785/785, McAndrew v=1755/v_vor=1711, Brodie 476/384, Madden 693/630, stars unchanged. Recipe unchanged (HANDOVER cont.11 §C).

**NOW UNBLOCKED / OPEN:** conditional-anchor / prospect-reward (UNRESOLVED 0c — gating makes first-years SAG because pedigree×P double-charges bust risk; THE next fix, only buildable now that gating is live); **JS-engine parity port of gating + Brodie (A1) — ✅ CLOSED cont.14c** (now in the JS recompute; parity 0/785); currency SCAR vs VOR (0i); thin-prior broad fix (recency-floor — ✅ CLOSED cont.14b).

**DISPLAY NOTE (not a bug):** the 4 auto-recalled players show their FILE pathway (Keane=Ireland, McAndrew=Mid-Season, Perez=National) while valued at their SSP re-entry — the documented auto-recall convention (PHANTOMS.md §0); McAndrew now joins Keane/Perez in it. Showing re-entry pathways instead would be a global display choice.

## SESSION 2j cont.(11) — PICK-1=3000 ANCHOR LOCKED + SCAR-vs-VOR DUAL-COLUMN BUILD (2026-06-21)
**rl_model.py + HTML changed.** (1) **Pick-1=3000 anchor LOCKED (permanent):** board now scales so pick 1 = 3000 (was 99th-pct player→7000 ⇒ pick1≈3867); pure global ×0.776 rescale, all relativities/trades unchanged (Sheezel 13226→10261, Pendlebury 706→548). Code: rl_model.py ~478 (`_P1=RL_PICK1 env; BOARD_FACTOR=_P1/PVC[1]; SCALE*=…; PVC*=…`; SCALE reassign rides val() late-binding). (2) **GAMMA switchable via RL_GAMMA env** (line 239; 0.85=SCAR concave, 1.0=VOR linear). (3) **One-off dual-column board:** each player shows SCAR + VOR (both pick-1=3000), built by exporting twice (RL_GAMMA 1.0→v_vor, 0.85→v) + merging by id (787/787); HTML got a VOR `<th data-s="vor">` (_body.html, 10 cols) + sort case + pick/player-row `<td>` (_features_v23.js; VOR shows at Now only). Picks IDENTICAL both columns (PVC GAMMA-independent). **Comparison:** stars rise under VOR (Sheezel +21%, Daicos +17%), depth falls (Papley/Barrass −34%), pick-level prospects ~unchanged — VOR rewards top scarcity, SCAR's ^0.85 tempers it. **PENDING: Luke locks the forward-value currency (SCAR vs VOR); then default that GAMMA + revert to single column. Pick-1=3000 stays.** Backup /home/claude/rl_model.py.bak.pre_pick1. **CURRENCY KNOWLEDGE captured (HANDOVER cont.11 §F):** SCAR="SuperCoach Above Replacement", val=SCALE·raw^0.85 (SCALE≈5.17 @pick1=3000, pure units; GAMMA=0.85 hand-set temper, no recorded derivation); VOR=linear best2-REPL (SCAR with GAMMA=1.0); replacement subtraction amplifies the top (raw 1.11<SCAR 1.81<VOR 2.0); curvature is NEGLIGIBLE on PVC shape (<1.5% indexed) → VOR-backward/SCAR-forward split sound; forward SCAR-vs-VOR ratio driven by AGE (corr -0.63) > value (+0.34). **README SCAR/VOR glossary corrected.** **Credit-phantom note (§G/UNRESOLVED 0h):** the two-Keanes/two-McAndrews double-count is **DELIBERATE** (PHANTOMS.md §2 — feeds IRE/MSD PICKEQ; Luke's call) — the credit phantoms outrank the real records via a fresh pedigree and show twice by design; **NOT a bug, do NOT remove from data**; only an optional cosmetic board-render filter is open. (Audit corrected an earlier mischaracterization of this as a bug.) **Pick-value rounding note:** engine ints (323/764/2143) differ a few pts from design grid (316/767/2142) via double int-rounding + 1-player pool diff; engine authoritative.

## SESSION 2j cont.(10) — v3.4 PICK-VALUE CURVE BUILT & SHIPPED (2026-06-20)
**rl_model.py CHANGED** (PVC builder replaced; forward model untouched). Shipped `rl_draft_engine.html` (board 787). Luke gave the explicit "build" after reviewing the cont.9/10 curve visuals and locking the R-0 proposal.
**BUILT:** `build_pvc_v34()` replaces the legacy `peakval`-curve. Method: MEASURE `posval(best2+capt−REPL)` busts→0 (no bust floor, no survivor clamp); RISK tiered CE α 0.6→0.8 (`PVC_ALPHA_LO/HI`); SMOOTHER varying-bandwidth local-linear (W 3 top→9 tail); TOP parametric power-decay a·k^b fit to picks 1-8 blended into loclin below ~pick 12; MONOTONE light isotonic (plateaus allowed); SCALE posval-VOR→SCAR by anchoring pooled picks 1-3 to the CURRENT board top (preserves board scale; pick1 3867≈old 3913). Knobs `PVC_ALPHA_LO=0.6/HI=0.8`, `PVC_REPL_BUF=0` (R-0; =5 for R-5). Code ~rl_model.py 427-475; legacy build_pvc/peakval kept (390/361); pedestal reads PVC at 541. Backup /home/claude/rl_model.py.bak.prev34.
**NEW PVC vs old:** 1:3867/3913 · 5:2762/3052 · 15:1572/1807 · 40:796/781 · 60:416/343 · 80:416/323. Flatter (top:tail ~9.3 vs 11.4): early-mid cheaper, tail richer, crossover ~pick40, tail plateaus 416. The richer tail = the TIERED α (not floor/clamp): flat α=0.6 crushes bust-heavy late picks; α→0.8 credits the rare hit (+72-119% picks 50-70). Empirical decomposition: NEW-measure FLAT-α tail (indexed 3.2) is LOWER than current's bust-floored (4.6); the tiered α flips it to 6.3. Survivor clamp is ~uniform ×1.10-1.14 (not a top/tail driver).
**BOARD IMPACT (pre/post diff):** proven players UNCHANGED (Sheezel 13226/Daicos 10739/Pendlebury 706/Newcombe 3826/McCarthy 3786; 120+g 0 movers of 218; 20-120g median 0.0%). Raw prospects (<20g) +16.8% median (149/266 >15%) — they track the pedestal/PVC; up because most sit at late picks where the new tail is richer. Pathways (PICKEQ) re-derived (IRE/MSD/SSP/UNR/PDA=90, PDN/PDS=96). Clean.
**MANIFEST:** M1/M2/M4/M8/M9 + parametric top DONE. Open: M0 (master patch incl. 548 positions), M5 (best2 ≥7→≥10 not done — curve uses current ≥7), M6 (captaincy bar not done), establishment-P forward dormant. Scaling-anchor (board-preserve) + tail (plateau) logged UNRESOLVED §0f/§0g. Design scripts pvc_smoother_viz.py/viz2.py/pvc_v34_vs_current.py bundled. Rebundled.

## SESSION 2j cont.(9) — BOARD-IMPACT ANALYSIS · CE/VOR LEARNINGS · v3.4 PVC DESIGN RECOMMENDATION (2026-06-20)
**No build, no data change** (rl_model.py/data byte-identical to cont.8). Analysis + design consolidation on the position-filled v3.3.1 baseline. Three things landed:
**(1) BOARD-IMPACT OF THE POSITION FILL — measured (regenerated pre-fill board from `/home/claude/rl_model_data.pre_positions.json`, diffed vs current).** ALL 787 active players are in BOTH boards (none were ever excluded from the LIVE board — the 548 positionless were all historical/retired). Change is BIMODAL: 438 unchanged (<0.5%), 195 dropped ~50%; median |Δ|=0.13%, mean 12.5%. **Split by career games (the pedigree-vs-production test): 0-20g (raw prospects) n=266 median −40.4% (146 movers >15%); 20-60g median 0.0%; 60-120g median 0.0%; 120+g (established) median 0.0% (1 mover of 218).** CONCLUSION: the positionless bug NEVER touched anyone with a real sample. Every player with 20+ games (521/787 — the whole proven/tradeable core incl. Sheezel/Daicos/Pendlebury) was valued correctly all along. Only RAW PROSPECTS (<20g) were inflated ~40-50%, because a thin-sample player's board value leans on the pick-pedigree prior (peak_est blends pedigree-prior + own production weighted by games → thin sample = prior dominates → tracked the inflated PVC → halved when corrected). PRACTICAL: established-player trades were always fine; pick/prospect-heavy trades overvalued the speculative side by ~half — that's the population to re-examine. Reproducible: `rl_after/board_impact.py` (safe try/finally restore).
**(2) grid_v331.py REISSUED on the position-filled pool** (no exclusions now — positions complete). REPL-0 indexed (top band=100): 4-6=71.1Cur/61.1CE.6; 71-99=7.8Cur/4.5CE.6/8.4(.6→.8)/10.5(.7→.9); SSP 3.1@22Cur/2.0@22CE.6; MSD 4.3@21Cur/2.6@21CE.6 (MSD>SSP restored). At .7→.9 (+REPL5) the new tail overtakes Current. 21-25 remains a genuine cohort-quality trough (survives the fill). SSP wants cy≤2022 (Nic Martin), MSD cy≤2021 (2022 MSD class dilutes).
**(3) CE/VOR CONCEPTUAL LEARNINGS (groundwork for M4).** CE_α=(mean(x^α))^(1/α) monotone-increasing in α; **CE.5 is NOT the median** — it's a downside-weighted mean (busts pull it), higher α weights the ceiling/stars (toward the mean). To reward ceiling go UP (.7), not down (.5). The backward pool value IS a VOR system: posval(best2+capt−REPL). VOR PRE-AMPLIFIES stars: 81 vs 85 avg (REPL 80.1) = 0.9 vs 4.9 VOR = 5.4×; posval softplus COMPRESSES near replacement (2.56 vs 5.44 = 2.1×; posval(0)≈2 cushion), LINEAR above, captaincy SUPER-LINEAR at the elite top (avg 120→45). CE leverage far bigger on VOR than raw (.5→.8 swing 1.01× raw vs 1.32× posval-VOR). Because the VOR scale already does the ceiling-rewarding, α should LEAN LOWER, not higher. The tiered **0.6→0.8 reconciles**: direction right (raise α at the cheap end so bust-heavy lottery tickets don't read ~0), but VOR amplification CAPS it at 0.8 NOT 1.0 — at the mean the 71-99 band is **59% carried by the top 5%** of players (vs 15% at 7-9), an unrealisable payoff from a single pick. α matters most at the bust-heavy cheap end, barely at the reliable top (outcomes clustered). Single-outcome/own-team → 0.8; tradeable-market-asset → a notch higher but never the raw mean.
**(4) ⭐ v3.4 PVC DESIGN RECOMMENDATION (Claude's, for when Luke returns to build).** MEASURE: busts→0, posval(best2+capt−REPL); DROP the bust floor; DROP the survivor clamp from peakval (the per-player ≤3× amplifier that caused the 10-12-beats-7-9 inversion — VOR already rewards the ceiling), KEEP both forward. CE: tiered 0.6→0.8 capped at 0.8 not 1.0; REPL buffer 0 (softplus already cushions). SMOOTHING: local-linear (loclin5) primary + LIGHT isotonic top-coat for monotonicity (pure PAVA over-flattens into blocky steps) + VARIABLE bandwidth (light at the steep top, heavy in the noisy 56-99 tail); curve must end monotone decreasing. PICK-1 BOUNDARY: local-linear extrapolates the slope (low boundary bias, unlike local-mean which drags pick 1 down) + anchor the top to the pooled 1-3 BAND not a single noisy pick (also the =100 index anchor) + pin pick 1 + enforce monotone descent; optional parametric power/exp decay on picks 1-8 blended in below. MSD 1.5× inherits into v4. OFFERED (not yet built): render the loclin5+light-isotonic finished curve on the position-filled bands next to the current shipped curve, pick-1 region magnified. Full detail in HANDOVER cont.(9) + TODO M-block.

## SESSION 2j cont.(8) — POSITIONS FILLED (positionless 548 -> 0) (2026-06-20)
Luke filled ALL 548 positionless players (MID 151, GDEF 123, GFWD 105, RUC 61, KFWD 57, KDEF 51; 0 invalid) via positionless_players_to_fill.xlsx; folded into working json by key (548/548 matched, 0 positionless remaining). EFFECT: every washout now counts as a bust in its proper bucket instead of being dropped. PVC TAIL ~HALVED (pick-60 706->343, pick-99 ->229) — the shipped curve had been OVERVALUING late picks + pathways by excluding positionless washouts. Pathways fell (CE.6 REPL0: SSP 3.9->2.0, MSD 3.4->2.6 [MSD>SSP order RESTORED], IRE 3.7->0.9, UNR 6.6->1.5); late bands fell (71-99 11.0->4.5); early/mid ~unchanged. Band counts evened (26-30 now 95, Brad Howard placed). Anchors: Sheezel 13226/Pendlebury 706/Daicos 10739 stable; Newcombe 3928->3826, McCarthy 3925->3786. Re-shipped rl_draft_engine.html. Backup /home/claude/rl_model_data.pre_positions.json. M0 master-patch must now also fold in the 548 position assignments. Rebundled.

## SESSION 2j cont.(6) — v3.3.1 CONSOLIDATED BASELINE **BUILT & SHIPPED** (2026-06-20)
Consolidated the CURRENT/shipped curve (bust-floored peakval — method UNCHANGED, NOT v3.4) on the full up-to-date 2690-row DB (2003-05, ND gaps closed, Benjamin Johnson, 4 phantoms incl. 2 double-count credits, recall consolidations). NEW base mechanic: **MSD year-1 ×1.5 floor** (was ×2; Luke changed 2026-06-20) — load-time transform in rl_model.py (`MSD_Y1_MULT=1.5`, after line 3) scales each non-phantom MSD player's mid-season DRAFT-YEAR season games ×1.5 rounded down (avg unchanged) + folds into career total, so all gates fwd+bwd read it consistently. Phantoms excluded. **ZERO effect on PVC** (MSD not in the ND/RD pick-curve pool); moves MSD forward board values only (sign = debut−level: McCarthy +294 standalone, Newcombe −48; tiny-sample ≤4g jumpy e.g. Hall-Kahan). Built `rl_export.py`→`rl_build_html.py` → **rl_draft_engine.html** shipped (board 787, clean). Anchors (1.5×): Sheezel 13226 · Newcombe 3928 · Pendlebury 706 · McCarthy 3925. New-PVC (v3.4) work PARKED into HANDOVER/KICKOFF (cy≤2021 both-measure comparison + SSP/MSD relaxation scenarios + forward-path games-gate anatomy; scripts grid_compare_cy.py, msd_ssp_scenarios.py bundled). Backups `/home/claude/*.pre331*`. Rebundled.

## SESSION 2j cont.(4) — DOUBLE-COUNT PHANTOMS for KEANE/McANDREW (2026-06-19 PM)
Option 1 done: added value-carrying credit phantoms in the original pools (mark-keane-ire-credit best2~77.8 in IRE; lachlan-mcandrew-msd-credit best2~87.1 in MSD), no-gap scoring so the recall consolidation leaves them put. Real records stay in SSP => deliberate DOUBLE-COUNT across both mechanisms (Luke's call). Inflates IRE/MSD pooled value+hit+n feeding PICKEQ, intentional. Full canonical detail written to PHANTOMS.md. Working data 2690. Rebundled.


## cont.(15) 2026-06-21 — CONSOLIDATED DATA/PVC EDITS + BACKWARD-BOARD BUG FIXES (baked & built)
DATA (rl_model_data.json): Hawkins 2006 ND #41→#2; Smith #41→#11, Morton #43→#14, Cloke #38→#23 (all 2004 ND, slide-repack). 37 GC(2009-10)/GWS(2011) concession players removed (holes left). Shiel/Treloar/Cameron flagged `_pvc_exclude` (out of the PICK-CURVE pool only — build_pvc/build_pvc_v34/_natcv34 routed through `_in_pvc`/`_epk` with same-year slide-up; BASEPK/establishment/forward valuation keep the full pool so the 3 stay on the board; forward rescaled +1.12% via the shared pick-1 anchor).
CODE (rl_model.py): (1) `debut()` — ONLY MSD debuts in draft year; ND/RD/SSP + post-draft (PDA/PDN/PDS/IRE/UNR) all debut year+1 [fixes 2025 post-draft first-years on the -1 board]. (2) `_on_board` unplayed fallback bounded to entry+{1,2} [fixes long-retired/no-scoring recalls; retired-recalled 605→185]. (3) backward boards CONSERVATION-NORMALISED (-1 ×0.944, -2 ×0.901) [removes the raw younger=more-runway inflation; re-ported from rl_build]. (4) `_deplateau()` post-process ramps mid-curve flat runs through their endpoints, deep-tail floor protected.
GATES: JS parity 0/785 (max diff 1 convexity rounding); board 785; de-plateau leaves 0 mid-curve flats. Backups: /tmp/rl_model.py.preShiel, /tmp/rl_model_data.{preHawkins,postHawkins,postRemoval,locked}.json.
OPEN: Will Hayes duplicated record (2022 MSD + 2024 ND) needs dedup. UI future-position render + backtest spreadsheet regen pending.


## [cont.20] 2026-06-23 — v4 forward-projection integration + unproven-floor resolution (BUILD)
### Decided (with before/after evidence)
- Pining: explicit formula evaluated head-to-head vs v4 OUT-OF-SAMPLE (n=233 test) -> WASH (v4 RMSE 32.37 vs explicit 31.16, MAE 24.60 vs 25.14; correction backfired). v4 retained on evidence, not deference. Point-estimate floor ~24 MAE (bimodal piner outcomes); spread stored for hover.
- survival() REMOVED (v4 separates below-bar by 11.8pt; survival's <=9% was double-count).
- pedigree-persistence on proven guns: NONE (0.4 season, non-monotonic).
- KEY_DEF spike: V4_SPIKE_RETAIN guard added (v4 over-trusts +0.28; level_now SPIKE_CAP doesn't reach v4 projection).
### Shipped [to be finalised post-build]
- peak_est -> v4; P_HOOK=None; PROD_GATE='off'; DOBs in rl_model_data.json (composite key, 845/848); distribution stored; board rebuilt; parity; tarball.

### SHIPPED (cont.20 build complete, 2026-06-23)
- peak_est -> v4 forward-projection (memoized); production + pedestal both v4-driven.
- EXPLICIT unproven floor blended by games (EXP_PEAK_BASE/EXP_RETAIN/EXP_PICK_SLOPE; w=clamp(g/45,0,1)). Beats v4 on group calibration (4.8 vs 6.0). Low-pick developing players tempered (Archie Roberts left top-8); proven unchanged (Daicos 6569->value steady, w=1).
- V4_SPIKE_RETAIN={'KEY_DEF':0.69} guard live (fires on fresh 1.30x KEY_DEF spikes).
- survival() removed; P_HOOK=None; PROD_GATE='off'.
- DOBs in rl_model_data.json (composite key, 845/848). PVC snapshot (pvc_snapshot.json) breaks SCALE<->PVC bootstrap cycle.
- Distribution range stored per player (pkest_lo/mid/hi, v_lo/hi; dispersion shrinks with games) for future hover.
- Board: rl_draft_engine.html rebuilt (1.16MB, 788 active). Top: Sheezel 6849, L.Jackson 6639, Daicos 6569, Treacy 5493, Xerri 5448.
### FOLLOW-UPS (not blocking the static board)
- JS PARITY: v4 is sklearn -> cannot run in-browser. Static board shows correct Python values; the JS engine must be pointed at exported pkest_mid for live-slider recompute (currently would diverge on peak_est). KEY follow-up.
- Per-season avg/games history not yet in export (needed for hover).
- Dial post-workbook: EXP_BLEND_GAMES (45), V4_SPIKE_RETAIN (KEY_DEF 0.69, KEY_FWD off), position-tilt.

## [cont.20b] 2026-06-23 — JS/board PARITY RESOLVED (correction to earlier "static board" claim)
- DIAGNOSIS: board-vs-engine "0-9% gap" was NOT a bug — exported 'v' is the CONVEX value (_vP0 = point x cvx); MA.value() is the POINT value (_vpt). board_v = point x cvx EXACTLY (verified all players, e.g. Daicos 6569x1.0257=6738).
- The JS already reads the v4+floor peak via exported 'pn'/'ps' and applies convexity via 'cvx' — so v4 + the explicit floor ARE reflected in live recompute. (Earlier "JS can't run v4" framing was wrong: peak is exported, not recomputed in JS.)
- THE ONLY real divergence was surv/P: JS valuePlayer applied exported survival + establishment-P, which value() no longer does. FIX: rl_export.py now emits surv=1.0 and P=1.0 (matching value()). Verified: surv/P = 1.0 for all 788; previously-gated unproven players (Lalor, Sanders) ungated.
- NO JavaScript changes were required. render()->recompute()->valuePlayer now reproduces the modified engine.
- Confirmed current/future position split: proj_from_peak prices k=0 (current season) vs REPL[g0] (CURRENT position) and k>=1 vs the 'fut' split (FUTURE positioning). Intact.
- RESIDUAL: full numeric JS verification needs the board run in-browser/node (JS ports of projFromPeak/relC pre-date this work and are assumed faithful). Open the board and spot-check a few values if desired.

## cont.24 (2026-06-23) — DISTRIBUTION PRICING (U21-4) BUILT (standalone; NOT wired)
- NEW `forward_valuation/distribution_pricing.py`: finished model from the cont.23 starter. All 6 TODOs wired —
  band(GBR quantile) → v_at_peak(real-age full-chain; proven==value() for free, old declines) → pedigree prior
  (trend-extrapolated top) → shrinkage by `own_games + comparable_density` → relocation to peak_est for proven
  elite → E[v] over the convex scale → width guardrails. Retires (conceptually) β·PVC floor + cvx + runway + tenure.
- NEW `forward_valuation/dist_harness.py`: walk-forward harness for dist_value (retrain quantiles+prior+v4 capped,
  cohort held out; calibrate SCALE_DIST to ≥90% retention). Built, not yet run to convergence.
- Validates directionally: anchors Sheezel/Daicos <1.5%; Willem ↑ above pedigree; Mannagh > Bice > Clark (Luke's reads).
- `rl_model.py` UNCHANGED (hard rule: nothing wired into value()).
- RESOLVED end-of-session: the "run-to-run instability" was a lost-turn edit (server flakiness) that upgraded the
  relocation anchor to `band_anchor = max(peak_est, recent_best2, youth)` — a GOOD change delivering the Willem (3649)
  + Mannagh (702) lifts Luke asked for. Output now reproducible (md5 adcb592, two identical runs).
- REMAINING: (1) calibrate SCALE_DIST via harness (board slightly hot, Bont +7%); (2) Bont-class recent-credit
  judgment call (surfaced); (3) young-gun target censoring (cleaner Willem fix); (4) K_SHRINK surfaced (default 30);
  (5) reprice whole board + scan; (6) then wire into value() on Luke's go.

## cont.24 (later) — censoring fix TRIED + REVERTED (empirical)
- Implemented the young-gun completeness gate (hard + riser-only `is_censored_riser`). Both REGRESSED the validated
  per-player reads (Clark over-projected; Mannagh<Clark; anchors +4%) vs no-gate, because band_anchor already
  compensates and the downstream calibration was tuned to the current model. Kept OFF (MATURE_GATE=False). Reads
  restored exactly (Willem 3649, Clark 588, Mannagh 702>Bice 606>Clark 588, anchors <1.5%). See UNRESOLVED U24-B.

## cont.24 (later 2) — censoring fix RESOLVED via DOWNWEIGHTING (Luke was right to push)
- EXCLUSION regressed reads; DOWNWEIGHTING (soft, sample_weight on censored risers, RISE_YEARS=4) works: lifts young
  projections (Zane 358->444) WITHOUT moving anchors or flipping Mannagh<Clark. ADOPTED (CENSOR_DOWNWEIGHT=True).
  build_training now returns W; fit_models + harness take sample_weight. Reads (K=30): Willem 3672, Clark 661,
  Zane 444, Mannagh 680>Bice 600, anchors <1%, Bont 3209 (+8.4% accepted).
- Zane residual (still < Clark) = production-value vs pedigree-value tension (U24-F) — surfaced for the board, not changed.

## cont.24 (later 3) — SCALE_DIST calibration DONE (=1.0, validated)
- Harness walk-forward year-1 retention mean 98.8% (12 cohorts) -> in Luke's 95-105% target, no scaling. Maturation
  trajectory yr1-2 ~99% -> yr3-5 ~109% -> yr6+ declines, matching Luke's full target shape. SCALE_DIST=1.0 final.

## cont.24 (later 4) — WHOLE-BOARD REPRICE built + scanned (AFL_distribution_pricing_board_2026.xlsx)
- 746 active repriced (Board / Big movers / By position / By cohort / Sanity tabs). KEY FINDING: dist ~1.3x old
  engine board-wide (established players credited), RUC 1.55x — driven by recent_best2 crediting recent peaks of
  now-declining/volatile players (De Koning 76-now->3333, Meek 67-now->3444). Surfaces THE decision (U24-E): discount
  recent_best2 for decline/age (a years-since-best taper would protect Mannagh while taming rucks+Bont). Near-zero
  corrections (Sholl 5->967) are mostly the dist model fixing old-engine errors. 746 vs 805 roster note (U24-G).

## cont.24 (later 5) — recency taper on recent_best2 BUILT (RB_TAPER=0.55, surfaced)
- recent_best2 now recency-tapered toward level_now (RB_TAPER**years-since-best). Sholl 967->201, De Koning
  3333->2321, Meek 3444->2223, Bont 3089; young guns untouched. Residual: Mannagh->530 (<Bice/Clark — his 84 last
  year, same recency as De Koning 97); ruck residual is position-convexity not recency; Conway thin-sample. Board regen'd.

## cont.24 (later 6) — board pool fixed to canonical 805 (U24-G resolved)
- build_board was re-filtering MA.data (746); switched to MA.players (805, the deduped active board incl. the `extra`
  list). The 59 missing were unplayed draft prospects (0 games) — they price on pedigree (dist==value), so no movement,
  just inclusion. Board regenerated at 805 rows.

## cont.24 (later 7) — COHORT BACKTEST BOOK + non-play empirical (the artifact Luke kept asking for)
- build_cohort_book.py -> AFL_cohort_backtest_book_2026.xlsx: Summary (cohort value() as-of each yr vs PVC, walk-forward
  via BASE_REF) + per-cohort tabs 2009-2025 + Non-play analysis. Zero formula errors.
- FINDINGS: non-play discount is pick-band + position dependent + compounds (top picks ~neutral yr1, mid/late picks big bust
  signal, compounds by yr2). Smillie (75%) too high vs empirical (~43% for top-pick-not-played-thru-yr2); Patterson (93%) ~OK.
  Within-cohort DISPERSION (not aggregate) is the real issue: cohort totals ~96% but value mis-allocated from played-mediocre
  kids to thin-sample spikes. Outliers (Bodhi/Berry/Dowling/Caminiti high; Kyle/etc low) all = thin recent sample over-extrapolated.
- Metric care: used realized production value (career best-3, no pedigree) NOT value()-as-of (which bakes in pedigree -> circular).

## cont.24 (later 8) — cohort book: walk-forward FUTURE-LEAK fixed (Luke caught it)
- Luke spotted that as-of-2025, Kyle (pick 14) priced at PVC+77 while Taylor (pick 15, same pos) sat at flat PVC. ROOT:
  debut_factor keys off cg=sum(games over ALL scoring rows), NOT filtered by as-of year -> it counted Kyle's 2026 debut
  when valuing him "as of 2025" (a future leak). level_now was as-of-aware but debut_factor/peak_est were not.
- FIX: build_cohort_book as-of loop now TRUNCATES each player's scoring to rows<=Y before valuing (then restores), so
  debut_factor/peak_est/los_decay/level_now all respect the as-of year. Verified: all 2025 draftees now == PVC as-of-2025.
- Substantive findings UNCHANGED (non-play analysis uses full-career realized production by design; only the as-of
  trajectory columns were affected). This was a flaw in the BOOK, not the engine.

## cont.24 (later 9) — DIST-MODEL WALK-FORWARD BACKTEST built (build #1 of the proposal)
- forward_valuation/build_dist_walkforward.py -> AFL_dist_walkforward_backtest_2026.xlsx. Per focus cohort (grouped by
  DEBUT year), traces every player YEAR BY YEAR under the dist model: retrain v4+quantiles+prior+META capped at T with the
  cohort HELD OUT, truncate records to <=T (walk-forward, no debut_factor leak), value with dist_value. Summary + per-cohort tabs. Zero formula errors.
- BASELINE (current model, cohorts 2017/2019/2021, --fast): shape RIGHT (peak yr3-5 at 115-127%, then decline). yr1 ~97-98%
  across all three = just under Luke's 103-106% target (the gap the redesign must close). Per-player STABILITY CHECK validates
  Luke's concern: current model IS jumpy on some (Rowell 5865->2492->6066->3832; Josh Ward 2047->1032->2395->1301) — partly real
  form (Darcy breakout 822->3467) but partly max-of-anchors switching + single-season over-reaction. This book is the before/after instrument.
- Model-agnostic: swap in the redesigned dist model + re-run to measure yr1 lift + stability improvement. ~8s/cohort-year (fast).

## cont.24 (later 10) — BUILD #2 COMPONENT 1: conditional outcome-shape prior (DONE + validated)
- forward_valuation/conditional_prior.py. Replaces build_prior's symmetric-normal-from-incomplete-careers. Quantile GBR
  (Q=.1/.3/.5/.7/.9, depth=4 leaf=25 nest=400) of forward best-3 given [pos one-hot, log(pick), games-so-far, tenure],
  trained on 13,226 RESOLVED (player,as-of-year) rows (debut<=2021, censoring-corrected), busts folded in as low/0 targets
  so the lower tail is honest. cond_prior_band(p,models,Y) returns the band.
- WHY (rigorous, all-position): prior errs low PERVASIVELY (MID -5/-6, GEN_DEF -2/-11, GEN_FWD -5/-8, KEY_DEF/-FWD -3/-6 vs
  realized MEAN like-for-like). ROOT = censoring: build_prior trained on whole pool incl. still-rising incomplete careers
  (-3 to -8 drag); the downweighting fix was applied to the quantile band but never to build_prior. ALSO the symmetric band
  misfit tails (GEN_DEF pk3 prior p10/p90 54/101 vs realized 69/109 -> lower tail far too fat = a source of the young-high-pick crush).
  (My earlier 'GEN_DEF errs low' was partly cherry-picked: prior MEAN vs realized MEDIAN on a skewed dist overstated it. Owned.)
- VALIDATED: GEN_DEF pk3 p50 now 92 (=realized 92; was 77.5). p10/p90 calibrated across positions. Non-play reshaping WORKS
  (MID pk7 tenure1: 0g 45/81/107 -> 15g 62/98/115 — floor lifts, ceiling holds = Luke's insight). depth=4 fixed the
  over-smoothed high-pick floor (pk3 p10 48->62, pk8/pk30 p10 match realized exactly). Minor small-n over-projection at
  GEN_FWD/KEY_DEF pk3 (n=6-14) noted for component-2 blend.
- NEXT: component 2 (own demonstrated band, production-anchored + recency-aware) + component 3 (reliability weight = effective
  full-season games; blend prior+own, drop peak_est-relocation). Preserve 'proven ~ value()'. Then validate via walk-forward + 805 before/after.
- dist_before_snapshot.json written: all 805 current-dist values (the 'before' for Luke's end-of-build-2 before/after sheet).

## cont.25 (handover consolidation, 2026-06-24)
- Full handover rewrite for a clean restart: SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-06-24_cont25.md rewritten as the single authoritative
  current-state doc (orientation, the redesign architecture, the journey + dead-ends, all learnings/corrections, results,
  the strict-order next steps #1/#2/#3, files, engine cheat-sheet, Luke prefs). KICKOFF_PROMPT.md cont.25 banner prepended
  + bootstrap tarball -> cont25. START_HERE.md rewritten as a clean entry pointer. HANDOVER.md cont.25 block prepended.
- AUDIT fixes: conditional_prior.py standalone was BROKEN (validation block built 9-feature vectors after the level feature
  made it 10) -> fixed prior_q_at (+level=0 at draft) and replaced VALIDATION 2 with the Y1-level-lifts-the-band test.
  dist_redesign.py standalone table cleaned (dropped the superseded w/r/recent_best2 columns). Both verification commands
  now run clean. Verified the engine code + v4 pkl + redesign files + snapshot are all INSIDE the checkpoint tarball.

## cont.25 (late session, 2026-06-24) — REPL-3 locked, 805 before/after, board-review diagnosis
- REPL-3 LOCKED as dial REPL_DROP=3.0 in dist_redesign.py (acquirable-replacement recalibration; applied to v_at_peak pricing
  in redesign_value only, via try/finally save/lower/restore of MA.REPL; engine value() + anchors untouched). #1 calibration
  passed; #2 walk-forward stability win + REPL-3 logical maturation arc (OOS 2009-2025: yr1 94 / peak 113%). Books issued at
  REPL-2/3/4 + the fixed-prior full-history 2003-2025 maturation grid.
- 805 BEFORE/AFTER issued (AFL_REDESIGN_805_before_after_REPL3.xlsx; Board/By-position/Movers tabs, 2593 formulas, 0 errors).
  Board redesign-3 = 108% PVC, 124% value(). By-position: RUC 254% of PVC (the ruck convexity item, quantified).
- Luke BOARD REVIEW diagnosis: the redesign under-weights DRAFT PEDIGREE (late-pick producers high, young high-pick non-
  producers esp. KEY position low, played-modestly < unplayed inversion). Keane>Battle = uncertainty-convexity (games-driven
  band width + convex pricing; should be age-bounded). Position imbalance (G-Def high, fwds low). All in summary 5c/5d.
- APPROVED NEXT BUILD (not yet built): (a) position-specific REPL_DROP (fwd 4 / else 2); (b) gently-stepped position-adjusted
  pedestal floor (ref beta*E[v(prior-at-draft)]; protection decays with evidence x depth). Then re-run 805 + spot-checks.
- Docs refreshed: KICKOFF banner (full current state + next build), START_HERE (new REPL-3 verification values), summary 0/1/5a-5d.

## cont.25 (stress test, 2026-06-24) — third self-check, looped to clean
- Stress pass CLEAN on: REPL-mutation leak into value() (none; value(Bont) pre==post), REPL dict restoration, determinism,
  edge cases (pre-debut + brodie), full-805 (no errors/None/negative), build_dist_walkforward double-apply (none), and
  conditional_prior.py standalone.
- FIND (not a code bug): "value()" in all diagnostics + the 805 sheet = p['_vpt'] = MA.value(p,'bal') (POINT value). The
  shipped board value is p['_v'] = proj_value(0) = convex option value, capped CVX_CAP=1.25 (rl_model.py L851). _v = _vpt x
  convexity; 26 players at the cap, all young. Sharman _vpt=302 / _v=310 (the documented 310 anchor = _v, correct). Diagnosis
  REINFORCED (young high-picks even more under vs _v; established producers _v==_vpt; no flags flip). INSIGHT: the engine's
  option value is additive-only + capped at +25%; the redesign's band-convexity is uncapped (Keane runaway) and can dip below
  point value (Uwland) — the same structural gap the Keane temper (cap convexity) and the pedestal floor (floor the baseline)
  address. Documented in summary 5e + KICKOFF + START_HERE. NEXT 805 regen will add a _v column.

## cont.25 (cold-start onboarding audit, 2026-06-24) — fourth check, "new hire's first day"
- Simulated a zero-context restore. Found + fixed THREE cold-start hazards a continuing-chat check missed:
  1. setup.sh installed unidecode but NOT scikit-learn (the v4 model + redesign GBRs need it) -> a new hire's "setup OK"
     was silently incomplete and the first real command would ImportError. FIXED (sklearn added to setup.sh).
  2. README.md header + "section 7 / where things stand" were STALE (cont.23/cont.16: "next build is distribution pricing",
     "HANDOVER cont.16 is live") -> the conventional first file misdirected to a 2-3-session-stale state, and its read-order
     conflicted with START_HERE. FIXED (header + section 7 rewritten to cont.25; doc table adds START_HERE + cont.25 summary +
     forward_valuation; glossary extended with the band / v_at_peak / REPL_DROP / _vpt-vs-_v / pedestal-floor vocabulary).
  3. forward_valuation/ had 40+ files (live redesign next to deprecated prototypes + 4 peak_model*.pkl) with NO map.
     FIXED (forward_valuation/CURRENT_FILES.md: live trio + v4 model vs superseded/prototypes, explicitly).
- README sections 1-6 (purpose, run recipe, glossary, how-Luke-works) were already excellent cold-start material — preserved.

## cont.25 (consolidation + KPP/Petracca/candidates, 2026-06-24)
- Build consolidated to ONE formula in the redesign module: value = brodie x lens x E[v(games-weighted blend of at-draft &
  current-level bands, age+position-conditioned)] at per-group REPL (-4 fwd/-2 else). Demo floor DROPPED (band covers vets;
  would inflate board). Floor protection calibrated to EMPIRICAL recovery (KPP calibrated separately, ~30-47% at a KPP bar).
  Strip from engine: proj_value convexity, raw-PVC pedestal, relative-floor, age-gate, spike guards. +25% cap tested-not-adopted.
- Petracca eligibility confirmed (bnow=GEN_FWD props his value). Uwland trajectory mapped (1849 draft -> 1481 at 14 weak games).
  Candidate list for role-risk cut (39, rucks dominant). KICKOFF + START_HERE refreshed to the consolidated plan.

## cont.27 (2026-06-26) — PAR BUILT + A/B/C VALIDATED (U26-REDESIGN). Full: SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-06-26_cont27.
- par_build.py: PAR surface locked (level_pos(log-pick)+ramp_pos(tenure), additive, recency-wtd target, gate >=6g,
  cohort 2003-2018). Reconciles MID yr1 pk1-8 = 66.7 (anchor 66.0). Ramps un-pooled; thin protection in level kernel-ESS.
- Par-centred production BUILT as standalone mock (par_redesign.py) + VALIDATED. Retrain (one feature redefined,
  train/inference-consistent) kills the frozen-GBR OOD artifact (3g/61: prod 3423->1050, p50 108->79).
- A: floor beta=0.85 too high (at top-pick par-production); beta~=0.5 safe across positions. [CORRECTED mid-session:
  earlier "single beta can't work/re-anchor" was a Fork-A synth bug; par-production is healthy, ratios rise with pick.]
- B: non-play tilt LOCKED to band space (p50 bounded-down + p10 fat-left + p90 PRESERVED). Tilt-in-level -> OOD.
- C: tilt magnitude = base-rate-relative shortfall; yr1 base=0 -> first-year zero-drag emerges; tenure ramp emerges.
- READ-OUT GATE: all three fall out at ramp 14/beta 0.5 (Cumming par-held 1349; 61-vs-21 separated 1248 vs 981;
  Patterson hold-pedigree wide-band; yr3 non-establisher tilt fires correctly). Par + insertion + A/B/C validated.
- conditional_prior.py: +RL_PRIOR_TREES env (default 400, no change; 200 for mock speed).
- NOT WIRED. Next: ramp sweep -> finalize beta+tilt caps -> wire-in + regen board/HTML on explicit go.

## cont.27 UPDATE — surface cleaned, beta locked, Fork B banked
- par_build.py: weighted-isotonic monotonization (Decision-D class) -- level non-increasing in pick, ramp
  non-decreasing in tenure. Fixed GEN_DEF pk8<pk15 (noise) + KEY_FWD yr5 dip (backfitting artifact). Reconcile 66.9.
- FLOOR = position-specific beta (scorers 0.50 / defenders 0.28), gated by real-player check (par defenders price
  370-1000, confirming the low ratio). Two-tier trigger documented: >2 tiers -> switch to realized-level floor
  (position-specific beta == realized-level floor at lower fidelity; same insight).
- Fork B BANKED: recency-weighted shortfall; stress p90 preserved across range, cap binds only at extreme washout.
- NEXT: ramp sweep (responsiveness/inertia frontier: pair sep at 3g vs 15g across ramps, Cumming pinned).

## cont.27 UPDATE 3 — ramp sweep + pre-debut reconciliation (corrected) + sole-path resolution
- RAMP SWEEP (par_sweep.py, pre-floor): ramp 14 over-reads (growth 1.3x); ramp ~22 sweet spot (3g+434/15g+1112,
  2.6x); frontier NOT flat -> separation is evidence-weight-driven. Cumming par-held across all ramps. RECOMMEND ramp 22.
- PRE-DEBUT RECONCILIATION corrected (synth age-confound): vs PVCxmult, uniform high-pick ~50% markdown (GEN_DEF 41%,
  MID 52%), converging ~100% at late picks -> band UNDER-CAPTURES high-pick pedigree UPSIDE => decision 2 = (a) restore
  upper-tail dispersion at low evidence for HIGH PICKS only (late picks reconcile, don't touch).
- SOLE-PATH: par-path becomes sole pre-debut value; PVCxmult retired as valuation path, survives only as floor anchor.
  Restore high-pick band upside BEFORE wiring. League-reality call: set upside magnitude to actual draft-capital trades.

## cont.27 UPDATE 4 — (a) locked; markdown decomposed; tail-restoration plan
- Check 1: PVC = expected-value curve (busts->0, CE-averaged) not a pole => high-pick gap is under-pricing => (a).
- Check 2 (decomposition): clipping is POSITION-dependent -- MID(116 vs 105)/KEY_FWD(101 vs 88) under-dispersed (BUG),
  GEN_DEF(103 vs 102) correct (leave; low-scarcity defender, ties to beta finding). Root cause = quantile fit smooths
  the sparse high-scoring tail (dispersion axis, not pick axis -- position-dependent at same pick proves it).
- PLAN: restore upper quantiles toward empirical at-draft, evidence-weighted, exposure-0 = empirical; MID/KEY_FWD only;
  leave GEN_DEF/KEY_DEF + late picks. MUST hold at preseason/0-games (Duursma test). Magnitude vs league trade values.

## cont.27 UPDATE 5 — tail-restoration prototype (tail_restore.py)
- New module: restores band upper quantiles (p70/p90) toward smoothed-monotone empirical at-draft tail,
  evidence-weighted (full @ exposure 0), MID/KEY_FWD + high picks only, only-raises, GEN_DEF/KEY_DEF untouched.
- DUURSMA PASSES: pk1 MID 0g preseason -> 2596 (79% full pedigree), continuous through debut (no jump/crash).
- Restores MID high picks 50% -> 80-90% of PVC; KEY_FWD to empirical ceiling (64-69%); GEN_DEF control 40->40.
- Residual pk1 gap (79%) = PVC best2+CE vs v_at_peak best-3 pricing method (NOT clipping, NOT captaincy -- both
  include capt_prem). Engine-consistent; set magnitude vs LEAGUE TRADES. Two moments orthogonal (season haircut = wire-in).

## cont.27 UPDATE 6 — clean synth curve + PVC-vs-v_at_peak seam + seam doc
- PART 1 (magnitude artifact): clean synth pre-debut curve pk1-8. MID 2596->1718 (79-92% PVCxmult, monotone);
  KEY_FWD 1252->1011 (49-69%, tiny pk1<pk2 blip from thin data). Restored = empirical-p90 floor; magnitude vs trades.
- PART 2 (seam on known truth): established MIDs two-way. Par-path gives sensible forward values (elite in-prime
  2800-4000, declining vets nil, busts 0) -- v_at_peak validated. par/PVC ratios conflate perf+age; clean seam = Part 1.
- CLEAN SEAM: par-path ~13% below raw PVC at pk1, converging by pk5 -> PVC hot at TOP picks. Verdict: if in-prime
  par-path matches gut, PVC is hot.
- PART 3 (doc): PVC = reference not ground truth, ~13% hot at top, under beta-floor; resolution = realized-level-floor
  MIGRATION not recalibration (floor binds at low-value where seam ~0, so practical impact small). "Retire don't recalibrate."

## cont.27 UPDATE 7 — PVC two-jobs; position-mix pick-value curve; best-3 findings; aging LOG
- PVC two jobs locked: A=pick valuation (->par-path pre-debut/position-mix curve), B=floor anchor (->realized-level
  floor). Retire once both replaced -> now done.
- (1) BUILT position-mix pick-value curve: pk1/5/10/20/40 = 2176/1493/1058/539/352 (mix-weighted par-path pre-debut).
  ~67-72% of raw PVC; empirical-floor magnitude (dials lift high picks); RUC per-position noisy (small weight). DIALS UNBLOCKED.
- (2) PVC seam documented: hot ~13% at top picks only, floor binds where seam ~0 -> retire don't recalibrate.
- (3a) LOG: best-3 no partial-sample regression (Heeney 12g/124). FIX later: regress partial seasons (thin-evidence at peak layer).
- (3b) CHECKED: trajectory already captured forward via recency-wtd level (rise 3163 vs fall 2227, same avg) -> NO 2nd
  recency mechanism (double-count); never on ceiling best-3; smooth decay only if ever.
- (4) LOG: quality-blind aging (DELTAS one shape). Survivorship caveat (don't fit on raw late-career elites). 80/20
  candidate = shift PEAK_AGE later for high-lp via existing machinery. Defer fix.

## cont.27 UPDATE 8 — dials=0; pick-curve shape (survivor bias); RUC flag
  > SUPERSEDED IN PART BY U9: NO join filter (never-played are in master + emitted as bust training points,
  > checked 3 ways); flatness is a BLEND issue (RUC + mid-pick under-leveling); realized gradient = 1.70x not 1.50x.
  > dials=0 and the RUC flag remain correct.
- DIALS SETTLED = 0 (MID expected-outcome no premium/haircut; KEY_FWD strong corroboration 42-69% matches 40-70% gut).
- SHAPE CHECK: captured pick20/40 empirical 1.50x ~= par-path 1.53x BUT bust-capture badly under-counted late
  (never-qual 0%@1-10, 14-20%@31-60, vs reality ~40-55%); median pick-40 = 9. Survivor bias -> true gradient STEEPER ->
  ~2x intuition correct, par-path too FLAT at back. FIX: fold full draft lists (never-played=0) or bust-rate correction.
  High-pick dials UNAFFECTED. Sequencing: fix-then-wire vs wire-then-steepen -> Luke.
- RUC per-position pre-debut unreliable (thin) -- harmless in blend, flag before individual ruck pricing.

## cont.27 UPDATE 9 — join diagnosis (CORRECTS U8): no filter; read confirmed 1.70x; cause = blend composition
- NO inner-join filter: 745 never-played in master (all channels), valid positions (0 dropped), emitted as bust
  training points. U8's "missing busts" framing was wrong.
- Clean gradient (ND-only national axis, decided cohorts, loclin fine): pick20/40 = 1.70x, 15/40 = 2.07x. Original
  1.50x was binning+pollution artifact. Read CONFIRMED too-flat; ~2x right direction.
- Cause = BLEND not bands: bands gradient-faithful (MID 2.04 vs emp 1.93). Flatness from (a) high-ceiling MID
  under-leveled at mid-picks (537 vs 1097; tail_restore fade ends pk16) and (b) unreliable RUC at 10% late inflating.
- FIX = design call (not left-join): extend tail_restore mid-pick fade + fix RUC. TENSION: touches mid-pick magnitudes.
  Pending Luke direction.

## cont.27 (post-2nd-compaction)
- VERIFIED MID "12%" = mostly PEAK_AGE measurement artifact (level-dependent: elites agree 3-9%, modest best3 ran 30-48% hot). Risk-discount story FALSIFIED (clean residual narrows with pick). pk1-8 STAND; no scaling fudge.
- tail_restore.py: fade extension PICK_GATE 16→26, TAPER_FULL 8→20, _build_curve range→27, emp_q cap→26 (full restoration pk1-20). pk1-8 byte-identical; pk9-20 lifted to 0.92-0.99 of clean-realized.
- pickcurve_build.py: RUC scorer-shape pool (mean of MID/GEN_FWD/KEY_FWD par-path × RUC/scorer level ratio). Monotone; kills late-pick inversion.
- Corrected blend (1/5/10/20/40): 2176/1504/1130/665/325. Blend gradient 2.05x. Clean realized gradient = 1.76x (the "1.70x" ref was PEAK_AGE-contaminated).
- OPEN: pk21-40 extension (→1.76x) pending Luke's call + pk40 survivorship verify.

## cont.27 (post-2nd-compaction) cont'd — pk21-40 extension + survivorship gate
- SURVIVORSHIP GATE passed: busts retained (debutyr is draft-based; fwd_best3→0; busts pull pk40 -14%). Censoring boundary refined: realized stabilises at draft<=2017/2018 (resolved grad 1.69-1.73x, pk40 430-452); earlier 1.76x was right-censoring-contaminated.
- tail_restore.py: PICK_GATE 26→46, TAPER_FULL 20→40 (full restoration pk1-40, fade pk40-46), range→47, ±15 smoothing fallback, emp_q cap→46. pk1-8 byte-identical; pk20 1004→964 (smoothing correction). MID anchored pk1-40 (0.97-0.99).
- Corrected blend (1/5/10/20/40): 2176/1505/1131/647/392, gradient 1.65x. Realized-blend 1.73x is contaminated at pk20 by GEN_DEF/RUC outliers; clean MID column anchors at ~1.93x.
- FLAG: KEY_FWD 25-35% above realized mean (restoration→p90, KPF bimodal). Awaiting Luke's KPF call + blend sign-off.

2026-06-29 sizing-prep gate close: convention confirmed undiscounted->flat-100. GATE 2 (responsiveness) FAIL on current engine = dead-pole (_floor_w->0@30g) perf-chasing, controlled pk1@70<pk20@72, bands pick-blind, magnitude 100-200%/20pt; real players confounded; Boekhorst anomaly flagged. GATE 1 (flatness) NOT passed: (b) pick-resolved decay measured (gentle-top/steep-deep) needs elapsed-opportunity axis; (a) survivorship-clean premium construction failed/open.

FIX: recover-perf->weighted _lvl_wt + POLE FADES by tenure (w*clip(1-(tenure-2)/3)). CONSEQUENCE: Riccardi>Jones (368>219), Georgiades>Kemp (1422>799) fall out naturally; well-shaped stay put (Serong/Daicos stable). Resolved Harrison(219)/Stephens(293) as pole-over-credit not input data (Luke's reads correct). Falsifier+delist+staleness+isotonic intact. Stage-0.
2026-06-29 POLE-FADE MEASURED (md5 7f7d7f76): V1 fade measured on TENURE [1,.76,.40,.16,.05,.05] (residual pick signal beyond demonstrated level; games doesn't decay cleanly; guess too slow). V2 flat target RULED OUT (corr 0.998 w/ weighted, mean|Dpred|=1). V3 bust was OVER-valued (level-vs-value: 0.70 level=0.08 value); fade corrects direction, residual recover-gate level-calibration flagged. 4 players hold, well-shaped stable, falsifier(young) passes. Stage-0.
2026-06-29 RECOVER value-space (md5 7f7d7f76 UNCHANGED): 8-15% target NOT supported (survivorship-biased read); measured value recovery 0.66-0.75 ~= current level-ratio RECY; recover-gate kept, bust enforced by delist/staleness. GATE 1 attempt confounded (cross-sectional, small-n), corr(value,prod)=0.53; needs within-player winners-normalised redesign, STILL OWED. No book. Stage-0.
2026-06-29 GATE 1 PASSED (leakage-guarded within-player, md5 7f7d7f76 unchanged): IS~=WF (leakage~0, read is genuine prediction); GOOD 34-84% par vs BUST ~0-1% (clean early separation); pole prices pedigree before proven (high-pick good 53%@draft->84%@T5, late-pick good 34%->production-driven); no violent moves. Last engine gate. Cleared for book (FULL format). Stage-0.

2026-06-29 BOOK DELIVERED (FULL format, engine md5 7f7d7f76, in-sample): AFL_RL_cohort_value_book_2026-06-29.xlsx — Summary (cohort×tenure SUM-ratio, AVG row) + 19 per-cohort sheets (2003-2021), per-player VALUE+PRODUCTION year-by-year paths draft->now, cohort-total SUM-ratio via SUMIFS (not mean-of-ratios), 0 formula errors. Drill 2019/2008-10/2021. FINDINGS: climb-or-cliff present (AVG 130->170%); current-by-cohort correct (old~2% retired, young 114-141%); delist->0 + stalled->1/4 confirmed at player level; MATURITY-EASING flag (good mature ~69-85% of own peak = GATE1 84% question, for Luke); 2020 COVID cohort anomaly; small-n tail blanked. No tuning. Stage-0, nothing baked.

2026-06-29 BOOK REBUILT FULL-CLASS (survivorship defect fixed, md5 7f7d7f76 engine UNCHANGED): cohorts were survivor-sized (~62, dropped washouts) = survivorship bias. Rebuilt on FULL draft class (ND+RD+MSD+PSD, 73-131/cohort), washouts at ZERO vs their pick. AFL_RL_cohort_value_book_FULLCLASS_2026-06-29.xlsx, 0 errors. CONSEQUENCE: AVG sum-ratio 123/139/130/130/129/121/109/92 (Yr1-8) vs survivor 130..170; per-cohort -14..-53% at Yr5. Survivorship was the inflator (curve drops to sane ~139% peak) -> survivors priced ~fine, not gross over-valuation; monotone climb broke into early-peak+erosion. Aging-elite depreciation (Petracca 4067->1763->2457 = engine does move with production) flagged for fuller check. NO bake, Stage-0.

2026-06-29 BOOK bust-timing = LISTED-WINDOW rule (engine UNCHANGED md5 7f7d7f76). Data has NO delisting dates (1642/1652 busts _retired-boolean only); inferred off_board=max(min-listed-window, last-game), concrete prior wins. Min window ND top20=4/21-40=3/rest=2, RD/PSD=2, MSD=draft+1. New AVG 145/165/132/131/129/121/109/92. Sensitivity: Yr3-8 robust (<=3pt across timings), Yr1-2 reflect held rookie windows (last_game+1 was too aggressive, zeroed washout rookies in debut yr). Canonical book = AFL_RL_cohort_value_book_FULLCLASS_2026-06-29.xlsx. NO bake, Stage-0.

== 2026-06-29  STEP 1 COMMITTED: #1-family thin-evidence/grower/Cook fix (engine md5 7f7d7f76 -> 38de7a01716d) ==
Supervisor-approved. Baked the experimental #1-family fix into rl_after/_merged_recover.py (inference-only; q97m+cm+ISO+pole
on ORIGINAL features then cp._lvl_eff/cp._feat rebound; band pickle cm_400.pkl UNCHANGED md5 34faa8659). Components: career-
evidence shrinkage (A down), grower current-level read _lvlcurr (B up), developmental tenure eff_ten=max(base,age-18) thin-only
(flips A<B), pole exposure-gate + early staleness (Cook decays). Proven-flat Delta=0 enforced via flat gate + proven-keep-real-
tenure + exposure-gate-thin-only + FROZEN pole table (force-populated pre-rebind). Verified vs pre-commit engine (/tmp/orig_engine,
7f7d7f76): A 2941->1096, B 1038->1403 (B>A); proven-flat 8/8 byte-identical MAX|Delta|=0; growers rise; Cook 879/456/411/365/319;
Boekhorst delisted unchanged 16. PROVISIONAL dials (PROVEN_N=4,FLAT_TOL=3.0,LDECAY=0.40,POLE_RAMP=22,c=n/4) flagged for step-3
calibration (NOT baked). Pole is pick-side = frozen until step 2-4. NEXT: step 2 monotone pole smoothing all positions + RUC pooling.

== 2026-06-29  OVERNIGHT FULL BACKUP (engine 38de7a01, Stage-0) ==
Step-2 ACTION-2 pole-basis recompute done (analysis only, engine unchanged): corrected-band pole shift is position-AND-pick
dependent (MID+30/GEN_FWD+53/KEY_FWD+20/GEN_DEF+13/KEY_DEF+21/RUC+4 %) and ~7x sensitive to synth maturity -> largely a synth-
construction artifact (thin synth shrunk toward higher-tenure par prior), pole absolute level FRAGILE (step-3 anchors it).
Entanglement: par_pole recomputes through the band; proven-flat byte-identical only with the FROZEN pole; PRODUCTION is the
invariant, not ev. DECISION (C) recorded: zero the maturation lift for PROVEN players (rest on production), pole touches only
unproven -> permanent decouple. PVC declared DEAD (replaced by Park-1 pick-value curve final design). Three parks + Kondogiannis
test written to START_HERE/UNRESOLVED. Backup tarball = afl_rl_BACKUP_38de7a01_2026-06-29.tar.gz (cold-verified). Step 2 = morning.

## [2026-06-29] STEP 3 CALIBRATION DESIGN (DESIGN-ONLY checkpoint; engine UNCHANGED 38de7a01, Stage-0, NOTHING BAKED)
Heaviest design phase; checkpointed before timeout risk. All ASPIRATIONAL (agreed, not wired). See START_HERE ★STEP 3 section.
- LDECAY final groups: KEY 0.40 / GEN 0.35 / MID+RUC 0.225 (RUC measured-in via direct stability, not the edge-optimal fit).
- EVIDENCE→WEIGHT SURFACE accepted in full (replaces step-1 c=n/4): w(cumulative games × signed dist-from-par × age), all axes smooth.
  above-par w=1 (never drag outperformer; growth via band tenure; margin/variance thread CLOSED, no haircut, A>B on the mean);
  near-par smooth over games; below-par 2D games×AGE (young keep prior, old converge); AGING-ELITE (Park 3) homed in old-below-par.
- POLE LEVEL basis agreed (NOT computed): root cause = arbitrary 2yr synth maturity; fix = unbiased-expectation-derived maturity,
  distribution-integrated (kills 7×), upside preserved (above settled), in-architecture. HARD GATE: must not crater unproven value.
- Standing instruction reaffirmed: no hard cohort/threshold boundaries; smooth over the natural axis unless data shows a discontinuity.
- NEXT: compute pole re-level + robustness + hard-gate spread → re-checkpoint; then dial read-offs + walk-forward incl. recent cohorts.

## [2026-06-29] STEP 3-B POLE RE-LEVEL — APPLIED TO ENGINE (38de7a01 → e0ac9c377d1e; Stage-0, not baked to board)
ACCEPTED + applied. Per-position scale in par_pole: MID 1.19/GEN_FWD .93/KEY_FWD .95/GEN_DEF 1.08/KEY_DEF 1.05/RUC 1.13.
Basis: trajectory-integrated pole (mean price6(par-synth) over development T1-5) / 2yr synth; piece-2 monotone SHAPE kept, LEVEL rescaled.
- The "5× over-level" was the confounded proven-settled comparison — gone; the level was ~right, the BASIS was the broken thing, now principled.
- Robustness PROVEN: integrated pole moves 4-12% on maturity-window perturbation vs single-point 1.2-2.1× (the 7× was extreme single-point).
- HARD GATE PASSED (authoritative panel): A 1096→1096, Attard 511→533 (+4%), hi-pick rookie +6%, mid-pick rookie −2%, Cook identical.
  First-year/unproven NOT cratered. Proven-flat Δ=0 ON THE LIFT (Daicos/Soligo/Bramble exact); ≤0.8% iso-guard structural rebuild (Ward +0.8%).
- MICRO-CALLS: (a) ACCEPT the ≤0.8% iso-guard drift (do NOT freeze ISO — correct downstream recompute, not a leak; document as lift-Δ=0 + iso ≤0.8%).
  (b) SKIP the realized-outcome bias cert (would reintroduce the rejected realized-par-pick comparison; aggregate bias belongs in the backtest book, steps 4-5).
- Upside preserved: scaled pole above proven-settled-at-par every position. Pre-pole engine preserved at _merged_recover.py.PREPOLE_38de7a01.
REMAINING STEP 3 (batched next): (1) dial read-offs off the surface; (2) walk-forward incl. recent cohorts. Then step 4 (pick-value curve).

## [2026-06-29] STEP 3 — CLOSED (final batch: dial read-offs + walk-forward; engine UNCHANGED e0ac9c377d1e)
- Dial read-offs: shrinkage-c SUPERSEDED by the surface; PROVEN_N per-branch (above ~0 / near ~2.8 / below-young = the 2D surface, no scalar);
  POLE_RAMP 22 unchanged; FLAT_TOL MEASURED per LDECAY group = KEY 10.3 / GEN 12.0 / MID+RUC 14.0 (ordering matches LDECAY; per-group, not one number).
- Walk-forward (incl. newest/ambiguous-year-1 cohort): leakage SANE (level-read pred/actual IS 0.911→WF 0.865, ~5pp < the validated 10pp; MAE blowup is
  forward-best-3 variance, not leakage). First-year value INTACT OOS in the FULL engine (449-player: year1-ev 1137 ≈ proven 1192, 0 near-zero, min 45, p10 123).
  The level-read alone under-predicts first-years (0.756) BY DESIGN; the pole fills the gap (Harley Reid y1 3686 vs proven 3510, ratio 1.05).
- GATES held (step-1 triplet; first-year not cratered IS+OOS; nothing board-baked). NO gate broke → STEP 3 COMPLETE. NEXT = STEP 4 (pick-value curve).

## 2026-07-01 (evening→night) — DIAGNOSTIC ONLY; head 8aed420a UNCHANGED (nothing baked)
- Book machinery corrected: opp-matched SUM-RATIO summary; 2003-excluded + 2015-24 secondary-line variant. [WIRED in book scripts; VERIFIED regenerates]
- Directive-v3 low-games: +0.1-retain raise lifts Yr1 +5.6% (abs); unified w-blend backfires −23%. [PROPOSED; not wired]
- Current-season-drop: reliability-shrink hypothesis FALSIFIED; "correct aging" FALSIFIED; mechanism PINNED = exposure-feature/recency-decay channel, cohort-varying (young −48% ≫ old −26%), not level/shrink/aging.
- Decay-proration prototype (Phase-2): INERT historically (byte-identical); NON-VIABLE as specified. [PROPOSED; overlay kept distinct from head; REWORK needed]
- No head/store/band change.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 2 (diagnostics + gate re-specs; ZERO engine/store edits; scratch evals only): Luke's rulings (turns 09-10) folded into ship_gates_check.py — B1 = pooled rise to peak by yr4-5 (yr6 acceptable), pre-peak dips <5% tolerated, no yr6-hold (pooled peak N=4 R=160, path_ok, 17/17 cohorts still PASS); B6 = whole 0->6 ramp with 0-game sit-out anchor (anchor 745 == 1-5g 745, flat-then-step +2518 confirmed verbatim; DECLARED smoothness thresholds: no step >50% of 0->6 rise, >=25% by 3g), monotone clause unchanged; B5 population = ACTIVE/LISTED only (inactive value=0, remains in backtest denominators at 0; offender list unchanged, 0 delisted among the 9); A6 bw 0.6 RATIFIED via delegation; B2 tol 5.0 provisional — N=5 noise floor measured 0.00 %-pts (byte-identical metric tables). Diagnostics: H-WARD FALSIFIED as sole cause (M1+v7 scratch flips A9 1677>1253 + A2's Weddle leg + clears all A5 floors; Curtis 1087 < Ward 1253 survives); B4-h1 NOT CONFIRMED (stage0-store regen c16e1024 vs shipped b8f9e998 vs reconciled-regen 1898ead7; shipped-vs-regen diff structural/large: SCALE 6.53->4.49, intakePickSum ~x0.6, PVC 99/99 subkeys -> evidence favors h3, cause NOT labeled; next isolation = canonical-engine e0ac9c37 x 3 seed stores); 9->10g dip = evidence-onset overlay capping Leff 72.1->68.6 at 10g, 29/36 cohort variants, worst -601 KEY_FWD pk40 avg105, monotonicity-violating; H1 (_lvl_wt thin-below-par) FALSIFIED again (Rozee -827 decay/exposure vs -368 level; d_level +1..+5% all cohorts). Year-schedule crater floor PROPOSED (yr1-4 0.25x, yr5 0.15x, yr6 0.10x, yr7+ 0.05x from smoothed p5 of listed ev/draftval; Luke signs; 0.25x provisional on board). Board 8 PASS / 9 FAIL / 5 PENDING / 1 STRUCK — statuses unchanged post-re-script. Nothing baked, head 8aed420a / store 644d1254.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 3 STEP 0 — GATE AMENDMENT + THRESHOLD RULINGS (script/doc edits only; SHIP_GATES.md text untouched per the frozen-file rule — amendments live here per the SHIP_GATES amendment process):
- A2 AMENDED (Luke, in writing, 02/07/2026): A2's Curtis leg is re-scripted from Ward < Curtis to Curtis >= 0.90 x Ward; A2's Weddle leg and A9 unchanged. Reason (Luke, verbatim): "same cohort; both durable; Ward averaged only +5.5 last season and +2.9 this season; nothing in Ward's 5 years suggests captaincy/convex upside; Curtis's G-FWD positioning already yields value above replacement NOW and each development point compounds it — the reality of Curtis is closer to Ward than the model suggested." Context: post-overlay ratio = 1087/1253 = 0.868, so the amended gate remains (barely) red pending the D3 ASK 2 residual/drop investigation.
- B2 tolerance SET = 0.5 %-pts in ship_gates_check.py (supervisor ruling under Luke's delegation, 02/07/2026). Rationale: measured N=5 leakage-spread noise floor = 0.00 %-pts (Directive 2 Task E, metric tables byte-identical across runs), so any gap >= 0.5 %-pts is signal, not noise. Supersedes the provisional 5.0.
- B5's draftval denominator provenance under question (Q3); any re-base/versioning decision follows Q3's answer.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 4 STEP 1 — INSTRUMENT AUDIT + GATE AMENDMENTS (script edits + one Luke-approved SHIP_GATES.md B5 note; amendments logged here per the SHIP_GATES amendment process):
- A8 AUDIT (Luke's arithmetic catch, D4 ASK1): the scripted expression WAS the literal 2x test (b > 2*t); raw values Berry=3473 / Tsatas=1083 make both reported passes GENUINE (engine ratio 3.21x, board-path 3.87x). The defect was DISPLAY AMBIGUITY — the detail string "Berry=3473 vs 2x Tsatas=2166" invited reading 2166 as raw Tsatas (Luke's 2x2166=4332>3473 arithmetic is that reading). Neither pre-named candidate (missing-2x / ±20% tolerance leak) present. FIX: detail string de-ambiguated to raw values + explicit ratio; comparison > -> >= per frozen "by at least 2x". Printout: session_2026-07-02/d4_a8_audit.txt.
- FULL GATE-LINE AUDIT (all 23 lines vs frozen 764a0d91 + logged amendments): 20 MATCH (6 in Luke-amended form), 3 MISMATCH — A8 (above), A10 (amendment unwired), B5 (signed schedule unwired) — all fixed this session. Table: session_2026-07-02/d4_instrument_audit.md.
- A10 AMENDED (Luke, in writing, 02/07/2026): threshold 0.70 -> 0.50. Reason: DATA-CAUSED per the SHIP_GATES failure triage — Curnow has banked 13 games of 2026; his level is 2026 form, not an engine artifact. PROVISIONAL + review note carried in the gate line (re-review at season-complete).
- A3 ANNOTATED (Luke, 02/07/2026): "evaluated PRE-LTI-layer" — the pre-LTI engine ratio is what A3 tests; a future LTI overlay must not be the thing that passes it.
- B5 YEAR-SCHEDULE WIRED (Luke, SIGNED in writing, 02/07/2026): floors by years-in-system yrs1-7+ = .45/.35/.28/.21/.13/.09/.05 x draftval; POPULATION = NATIONAL-DRAFT entrants only (post PRESENT_ID_OVERRIDES type=='ND'; MSD/SSP/RD/IRE/UNR/PDx + delisted/retired excluded). GENERATING RULE recorded beside the constants: floor ~= 0.9 x smoothed clean p5 (ND-only) — the re-derivation formula at re-base. RE-BASE-AT-PVC reminder written INTO SHIP_GATES.md on B5 beside A5's sibling note (Luke approved this frozen-file edit in writing; new SHIP_GATES.md md5 recorded in the D4 return).
- Supersedes the 0.25x proxy (D2) and closes the D2 year-schedule PROPOSAL (Luke named the numbers).

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 4 (Luke's ruling package — ONE-price execution + bake candidate + M3 derivation): PR #6 merged (post-merge main e8688a72). ASK1 audit: A8's scripted expression WAS the literal 2x (Berry 3473/Tsatas 1083, both passes GENUINE, engine 3.21x/board 3.87x); defect = display ambiguity (fixed + >= per frozen text); full 23-line audit 20 MATCH/3 MISMATCH (A8, A10, B5 — all fixed); board at head 9P/8F (A10 FAIL->PASS at 0.51 vs amended 0.50).

- LUKE'S RULING (verbatim, in writing, confirmed): "NOT every cohort must rise — the CROSS-COHORT AVERAGE at each year-depth must rise to a peak in years 4-6. Individual cohorts may dip by design: not all draft cohorts are equal; 2020 is a shocking draft — it should lose value."
- NEW B1 (wired in ship_gates_check.py): at each years-in-system depth d, the simple (unweighted) mean of indexed cohort value (yr1=100) across all cohorts observed at depth d must rise from year 1 to a peak occurring in years 4-6; pre-peak dips of the AVERAGE tolerated under 5% (tolerance carried from old B1 — now applies to the average only). Per-cohort curves UNGATED but printed as a pipe table on every gates-board run (Luke's eyeball channel — visibility without a gate).
- OBITUARY — the per-cohort backstop, RETIRED. What it was: every incurve cohort 2004-2020 individually had to rise above its yr1=100 index somewhere in yrs 4-6 (max R(4..6) > 100), scripted beside the pooled-rise test since the D2 re-script; 17/17 at re-script, 16/17 at the D4 candidate (cohort 2020 at 97/98/95 = the D4 bake-blocker). Why replaced: Luke ruled the LAW wrong, not the measurement — a uniform per-cohort rise requirement encodes "all draft cohorts are equal," which he explicitly rejects; a shocking draft SHOULD lose value, and a markdown that sinks such a cohort may be desired engine behaviour, not a defect (D5 ASK 2 decomposes whether the 2020 markdown is in fact mediocrity-concentrated). Ruling ref: Luke, in writing, confirmed, 02/07/2026, relayed via the D5 directive. The cohort table stays printed on every board run so a sinking cohort is always eyeballable.
- MEASURED at three states (session_2026-07-02/d5_ask1_newB1_three_states.md): head 8aed420a PASS (avg peak N=4 AVG=160.5, path_ok) · candidate fb39d88a PASS (avg peak N=4 AVG=147.6, path_ok; 2020 row 100/111/110/97/98/95 — visible, ungated) · same-builder fix-off control PASS (N=4 AVG=160.5). THE D4 B1 BAKE-BLOCKER DISSOLVES UNDER THE REDEFINED LAW.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 5 (growth-law gate rebuild + M1+v7 per-term decomposition + B5 evidence + LTI register; gate/doc edits Luke-ruled only; candidate branch READ-ONLY, measured never committed; NOTHING wired, NOTHING baked): PR #7 merged (post-merge main cecb0cc1). ASK1 B1 REBUILT to Luke's redefined law (entry above; SHIP_GATES.md a55921f6, ship_gates_check.py 5e6e34d9) — new-B1 PASS at head (avg peak N4 160.5) / candidate (N4 147.6) / same-builder control (N4 160.5); 2020 row 97/98/95 at candidate stays visible UNGATED; THE D4 B1 BAKE-BLOCKER DISSOLVES; head board re-run 9P/8F (counts unchanged, B2 re-verified leakage 0.0). ASK2 PER-TERM DECOMPOSITION (candidate basis; anchored one-line term-off patches, 5 sequential measurement loads + 3 same-builder 7147 matrix rebuilds; d5_ask2_perterm_decomposition.md): (a) the Curtis improver-squeeze = v7-cB (Curtis -195/-14.4%, Ward -324/-19.6%; M1 counter-lifts Curtis +184 while Ward's +3.0 gap < TOL_M1 earns 0); M1 owns the WHOLE A3 cost (-0.034; M1-off restores 0.692 = head; M2 offsets +0.016); v7-asc owns the B5 blowout (53 vs 82 when off). (b) the 2020-cohort markdown (-11.6% d4-6 vs control) is TWO channels: v7-asc mediocrity-CONCENTRATED (top-quartile -5.0% vs bottom-half -33.6%, Spearman +0.706 p=1e-08 — Luke's shocking-draft read CONFIRMED on the concentration test) vs v7-cB INDISCRIMINATE (rho=-0.024 p=0.87 — artifact-shaped, same term that squeezes Curtis); M1 lifts the cohort +3.9%; either compression off restores 2020 >100 at d4-6; new-B1 passes at every term state. ASK3 B5 EVIDENCE (numbers only, nothing wired): full 51-offender table at head w/ club/ratio/floor/margin (23 dev-window yrs1-8 / 28 deep-tail yrs9+); 31 candidate joiners, 0 leavers, v7-asc implicated in 27/31 (20 solo, 6 +cB, 1 +M2, 4 joint); yr8+ floors from the generating rule (0.9 x kernel-smoothed clean p5 ND-only, eff-n>=35 bw rule, 11+ pooled n=120 deliberately): d8 .011 / d9 .012 / d10 .021 / d11+ .012 vs flat .05 (raw p5 .012/.013/.090/.014) — the .05-forever tail binds ~4x above its generating data; Luke's boundary ruling pending. ASK4 LTI REGISTER CONTENT COMMITTED VERBATIM (closes the D4 content gap): Section A=32 LTI rows, Section B=11 out-for-2026; Maxwell King collision guard; D4 guards retained as trailer; md5 1b24df4e. ASK5 D4 clarifications (d5_ask5_clarifications.md): Tsatas NET candidate ev = 979 (the +9.0 M1 level-lift nets to -104 value-space; below Luke's preferred-lower 1083); A8 candidate trio Berry 2197 / Tsatas 979 / 2.24x; 6 unscored lines named (A13/A14 PVC-staged, A15 struck, B3 unenumerated, C1/C2 unbuilt); obituary completeness = 9 layers NOT 8 (row 9 = DEAD JS legacy chain, excision bake-gated) — discrepancy flagged. Head 8aed420a / store 644d1254 / band 34faa865 unchanged; workspace swaps restored + md5-verified; candidate fb39d88a untouched.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 6 (Gothard decomposition + floor-as-pricing-feature prototype + register-annotated offender table; NOTHING canonical moved; clamp prototype scratch-branch only; SHIP_GATES.md untouched): PR #8 merged (post-merge main b2671355). ASK1 GOTHARD DECOMPOSED (d6_ask1_gothard_decomposition.md): store AGREES with Luke's ground truth (13g @ 70.2 in 2026 · pick 12 2023 ND · GFWD no-switch · yr3 · his ONLY scoring season is 2026); the STALENESS CAP owns the ENTIRE 317-vs-sane gap — every pricing channel values him ~1790 (band 1815 w/ REPL[GEN_FWD] 70.9 vs his 70.2, perf/par 1.05; pole +12.6; iso 0.98) and ev()'s stalled-non-producer branch (el>=onset=3 AND ns<=1) overwrites to exactly 0.25×draftval=317.25; the cap counts qualifying seasons without asking WHEN/HOW GOOD (built for played-once-long-ago; Gothard's one season is the current breakout); counterfactuals: tenure-click -1yr 1480 · +one 2025 6g season 1938 · cap-off 1790; EVERY yr-3 offender at ratio ~0.250 is this cap (Gothard the only one producing); Gothard = 317 at ALL FOUR STATES (head/candidate/candidate-minus-cB/head+M3) — cB is 0 for his profile (effs 13/17<1), M3 scopes to g26<11 (he has 13); floor lifts 317→355 = a patch, the fix is a recency/quality term in the cap (candidate-branch item, Luke's word). ASK2 FLOOR-AS-PRICING-FEATURE PROTOTYPED per Luke's ruling (engine/prototypes/floor_pricing_clamp.py 66fbf0f6, scratch-branch, canonical ev() untouched): ev_final=max(ev, floor_yrs×draftval), ND-only (MSD/SSP+delisted/retired/pickless excluded), BOTH tail variants — A (flat .05 yrs7+, as signed): 51 saves +1287 aggregate (top lifts O'Meara +109, Dow +85, Martin +68; saves Haynes +4 / Hopper +48); B (D5 kernel tail .011/.012/.021/.012): 27 saves +394 (dev-window saves IDENTICAL to A incl. Gothard +38, Ugle-Hagan +57; Haynes/Hopper NOT saved — Luke's utility-value read is the case FOR A's tail or an exception channel); pure lower bound VERIFIED on the wired run (n=807: 0 lowered, 0 non-ND moved, byte-identical elsewhere); new-B1 under clamp PASS peak N4 @160.2 (vs 160.5) — IDENTICAL for A/B by construction (B1 window ends d7; variants diverge d8+); B5 gate-semantics amendment text PREPARED in d6_ask2_floor_saves.md (gate retired as alarm → floor feature + mandatory saves-table print) — NOT committed, SHIP_GATES.md untouched, awaits Luke's written confirm. ASK3 REGISTER-ANNOTATED OFFENDER TABLE (d6_ask3_annotated_offenders.md): head-51 + 31 candidate joiners re-verified FRESH this session (82-51, 0 leavers, matches D5); columns added: REGISTER (4 joiners are LTI: Gibcus/Clarke/Motlop/McInnes — LTI-haircut candidates, not floor saves; head-51 all clear), LUKE'S READ (seeded verbatim: 7 floor-save endorsed, 2 tolerable, 2 utility vets, Gothard HEADLINE WORRY), 2026 games; store AS-OF: no explicit timestamp field exists in the store (FLAGGED as REQUIRED_INPUTS gap) — provenance-derived cut R14/24 (SEASON_PROG 0.58), captured 2026-07-01. ASK4 D5 CONFIRMATIONS (d6_ask4_confirmations.md): A2@candidate-minus-cB 0.822 (1358/1653) RE-MEASURED fresh — supervisor ~0.82 CONFIRMED; new-B1 minus-cB peak N4 156.6 (D5 committed cite); v7 residual terms NIL (source-diff: _v7 = exactly cB on bb[3]/bb[4] + asc on bb[5], pivot/bb[0..2] untouched; all 31 joiners resolve to asc/cB/M2/joint). ASK5 effort rule registered (docs/process/PROCESS_CHANGES_2026-07-02.md §11: original-as-practiced + D6 amendment verbatim; original's verbatim text was never in-repo — flagged for supervisor correction). Engine loads: 4 (head decomp+sweep, candidate, cB-off, clamp verify), all sequential; head 8aed420a / store 644d1254 / band 34faa865 unchanged; workspace restored + md5-verified after the variant block; candidate fb39d88a READ-ONLY zero commits.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 7 STEP 1 — GATE AMENDMENTS (all Luke-ruled in writing; amendment process on the frozen file — SHIP_GATES.md edited under Luke's rulings, new md5 in the D7 return; script wired in ship_gates_check.py):
- A3 AMENDED (Luke, in writing, D7): threshold 0.80 -> 0.75, DATA-CAUSED per the SHIP_GATES failure triage — Connor Rozee is out for the remainder of 2026 (LTI register Section B, register-confirmed; nil further 2026-relevant production is a fact about the world, not the engine). Luke verbatim: "Happy to adjust Rozee to 75%." KNIFE-EDGE NOTE (recorded beside the gate): the bar deliberately sits at reality's edge — same design as A10/Curnow; the gate should fail the moment the engine over-punishes a thin season, not comfortably before. A3 remains [DC] and PRE-LTI-layer-evaluated (D4 annotation unchanged).
- B5 AMENDED (Luke-ruled; the D6-PREPARED text now COMMITS): B5 as a pass/fail ALARM is RETIRED; the signed year-schedule floor becomes a PRICING FEATURE at the ev() boundary — ev_final(p) = max(ev(p), floor_yrs(p) x draftval(p)), ND entrants only (MSD/SSP, delisted, retired, pickless never floored), floor_yrs = .45/.35/.28/.21/.13/.09 yrs 1-6 + FLAT .05 yrs 7+ (TAIL VARIANT A — as signed; Luke's D7 ruling resolves the D6 A-vs-B decision to A, the flat tail). Authorization (Luke, in writing, D6 directive): the listed ordinary players are "saved by the floor" — the crater floor becomes a value clamp standing in for the unpriced q90-97 upside tail, with a printed saves-list for visibility. The FLOOR-SAVES TABLE (player · club · yrs-in-system · raw ev · floor · saved-to · lift · register status) prints on EVERY gates-board run + the pure-lower-bound re-verify (0 lowered, 0 non-ND moved) runs with it — the saves-list is the new alarm surface; mispricings stay VISIBLE, never silently clamped.
- A2 UNCHANGED at 0.90 BY RULING (Luke, D7): the gate ships RED at the v2 config (Curtis/Ward = 0.822 measured at candidate-minus-cB, D5/D6 fresh confirmations). Luke verbatim: "we can look at Curtis down the line." Logged beside the gate in ship_gates_check.py; no threshold motion.

2026-07-02 DIRECTIVE 7 (RULED BAKE CONFIGURATION — BAKE CANDIDATE v2 assembled + gate amendments + full verification + staleness-cap fix DESIGN; NOTHING BAKED — v2 holds for the cold audit + Luke's explicit bake word): PR #9 merged as STEP 0 (post-merge main d0acfc08). ASK1 v2 ASSEMBLED (branch claude/d7-bake-candidate-v2, commit c16b970): **engine 4a134d05 / cp 5ac8b162** = M1 + v7-asc (**v7-cB DELETED per Luke's ruling — deleted not disabled**, _effs feed + GCAP removed with it; obituary in BOARD_LAYERS_OBITUARY.md ENGINE-TERM DELETIONS w/ D5 magnitudes, deletion commit c16b970, resurrection ref 0806d90) + M2 verbatim (f=0.545, 5ac8b162 byte-identical to D4) + M3 proportional-tenure WIRED FIRST-CLASS (the D4 monkeypatch hook inventory as in-engine pin plumbing: cp._age_asof/MA.age/PR.tenure/_eo/_feat-ten; value-space blend w=1−s(1−fE), fE=0.58, RL_M3_FE=1 kill-switch — byte-exact inert 0/807 vs a physically-stripped build f4b35501; scope verified all-g26<11; on-pace collateral 0/288) + the B5 PRICING FLOOR at the ev() boundary (ND-only, real-store scope, VARIANT A flat .05 tail per Luke's D7 ruling; pure lower bound re-verified at v2: 0 lowered / 0 non-ND moved / 54 saves +1684).

ASK3 FULL VERIFICATION at v2 (d7_ask3_v2_verification.md + ship_gates_report_4a134d05.md): board **11P / 5F / 1FEATURE / 5PEND / 1STRUCK**, every delta vs the D4 board attributed; **A3 measured 0.7307 (2917/3992) — RED by 0.019 at Luke's amended 0.75** (M3 owns +0.072; the supervisor's 0.74–0.78 range was optimistic); **Tsatas 1140 — ABOVE Luke's preferred 1083** (M3-caused, g26=0 full blend; 979 at fE=1; A8 holds 2.12x); Curnow A10 0.509 knife-edge PASS; A2 0.822 red BY RULING; Gothard 317+floor→355 (cap fix NOT in v2); Ward M1-TOL gap +3.0<5 confirmed; new-B1 avg peak N4 **156.2** on the v2-rebuilt book, 2020 cohort >100 everywhere (cB deletion restored it, per D5's prediction); walk-forward book v2 rebuilt (matrix s4_matrix_v2_4a134d05.json, xlsx c5a7adc8); panel: only designed axes moved (Green +6.2% = the M3 design's named spot row); B6 red-as-known + one new −3pt micro-dip at 7g (M3 blend seam noise, cliff-blend territory); B6 gate synth now carries top-level games per the M3 wiring-time note. ASK4 STALENESS-CAP RECENCY FIX — DESIGN ONLY, WIRED NOWHERE (d7_ask4_staleness_recency_fix.md + engine/prototypes/staleness_recency_fix.py): population enumerated at head (38 fire / 33 bind); exemption DERIVED STRUCTURAL — the cap must not fire when the sole qualifying season IS the season being evaluated (gap=0; a player cannot have vanished from a season in progress; ZERO invented constants; a gap=1 quality threshold REJECTED at finest resolution — three near-equal breaks on 1-5-game samples, no dominant mode); measured at head+fix a9e1c14b: **Gothard 317→1790 exact** (Luke's neighbourhood, no shaving), 7/807 movers all in-population (zero collateral), true ghosts stay capped, gates incl. new-B1 HOLD (B1 rises to 169.2 — released historical gap=0 cells lift the growth curve); SECOND GOTHARD FOUND: **Lachlan McAndrew 99→1408 (13g @ 87.1 = 1.11×REPL, the population's best current output)**; Form-B gap=1 extension priced for Luke (Busslinger 481→636 · Caiden Cleary 154→775; support WEAK; Luke's Hardeman/Cleary tolerable-reads stay intact under Form A). ASK5 CLARIFICATIONS (d7_ask5_clarifications.md): 807-vs-805 = 746 shared + 61 sweep-only (59 stale never-played + 2 double-count) + 59 extra-list, NOT containment; D6's B1 160.2-vs-160.5 EXPLAINED — index-denominator arithmetic (floor lifts d1 +1.04% vs d4 +0.04%; a lower bound on values is not one on indexed ratios; no drift, no transcription); distributional/quantile pricing output NIL (band bb internal to b6/price6, integrated to scalar by WQ6 — cited); BASE effort rule registered verbatim in PROCESS_CHANGES §11. INSTRUMENT CAVEAT flagged: verify_restore.sh's named-player axes execute repo-engine × WORKSPACE-conditional_prior (par_redesign.py:12 sys.path[0] insertion) — mixed-pair reads possible when repo and workspace diverge; all D7 measurements ran properly-paired workspace deployments. Engine loads: 9 (3 v2-block, 1 population, 2 sweeps, 2 boards+matrix chain, 1 recon), all sequential; canonical head 8aed420a / store 644d1254 / band 34faa865 restored + verified (panel 10/10); v2 4a134d05 on its own branch.


2026-07-03 DIRECTIVE 8 STEP 1 — RULINGS REGISTRATION (doc commits only; all Luke-ruled, relayed via the D8 directive; nothing wired, nothing baked):
- 1a A3 ACCEPT-RED at 0.7307 (Luke, 2026-07-03, verbatim): "Accept-red on rozee." A3 joins A2/Curtis as a Luke-ruled red on the board (0.7307 vs the amended 0.75 bar); the real remedy is the LTI workstream, queued. No threshold motion; the gate stays scripted as-is and ships red by ruling.
- 1b TSATAS ACCEPT-AND-TRACK at 1140 (Luke, 2026-07-03, verbatim): "Accept and track on Tsatas." The M3-caused lift above his preferred 1083 is accepted; TRACK = the value fades to 979 as the season completes (fE→1); A8 holds 2.12x.
- 1c CAP-FIX FORM A ENDORSEMENT WITHHELD (Luke, 2026-07-03, verbatim — the D8 governing finding): "The two cap fix is odd, because someone like Cleary is far too low when he triggers it and probably too high when he doesn't. That Hardeman doesn't get rescued is a challenging one for me. And looking at Cooper Lord - he's another in the Cleary boat but worse - he shouldn't be so low now, but the idea of him being over 1000 if it didn't catch him is a bit crazy to me." READ: the binary structure (caught → 0.25×draftval · exempt → full ev) is wrong at the margins in BOTH directions; the fix must become a GRADED rule (continuum ghost-floor → full price, driven by evidence of live output). The D7 Form A design read STANDS as a derivation artifact, superseded by the D8 ASK-2 graded round. Registered in docs/process/SYMPTOM_REGISTER.md (family 1) + docs/process/LUKE_RULINGS_LEDGER.md.
- 1d McANDREW RELEASE ENDORSED (Luke, 2026-07-03, verbatim): "McAndrew is fine." His D7 cap-fix release (99→1408, 13g @ 87.1 current output = 1.11×REPL) is Luke-approved; McAndrew is now an ANCHOR for the graded derivation (the STRONG-EVIDENCE UPPER anchor: strong current output → full release), no longer an open question.
- NEW REPO FILES: docs/process/LUKE_RULINGS_LEDGER.md (the rulings authority trail, previously supervisor-side only — handover rev93 §4) + docs/process/SYMPTOM_REGISTER.md (symptom families + Luke-verbatim evidence, previously supervisor-side only — rev93 §5). Both minted this directive per the D8 ASK-1 commit targets; backfill is pointer-only (references to existing CHANGELOG entries; no historical wording invented).

2026-07-03 DIRECTIVE 8 (staleness-cap GRADED form round 2 — driven by Luke's eyeball findings on the D7 lists; rulings registration; sweep hygiene; NOTHING WIRED, NOTHING BAKED — candidate v2 4a134d05 and canonical 8aed420a/644d1254/34faa865 untouched): PR #10 merged as STEP 0 (post-merge main 8954579f).

INTERACTIONS PROVEN: floor order (graded-inside-ev then boundary max) is LOAD-BEARING — reversed, the floor is defeated (Hall 152→136); post-grade the floor lifts exactly 4 rows (Wiltshire 86/Hall 152/Collard 170/Stone 97), double-lift NIL (grade>0 rows all price above their floors); graded×M3 composition at a future v3 UNMEASURED (v2 untouched) — h-M3-blend-seam-noise stays OPEN and now covers it. REJECTED variants shown: q-matched normalization (non-monotone at finite sample) · per-class baselines (fails Luke's Hardeman read). NEW HYPOTHESIS h-gap1-zero-games-returners (OPEN, LTI-shaped): zero-live-games historical cells realize HIGH (gap=1 v=0.68 n=25 uniq, survivorship-biased up) — "did not play"≠"played badly"; deliberately NOT priced by the cap (Luke's live-output axis); queued to the LTI workstream as first calibration evidence.
